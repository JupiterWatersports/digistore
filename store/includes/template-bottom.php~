once the format has been chosen, the following changes should be made:
IF USING THE SITE WITH RIGHT COLUMN ONLY:
3 STEPS:
1) includes/template_top.php

		<div class="grid_2" id="column_left">
			<?php require(DIR_WS_INCLUDES . 'column_left.php'); ?>
		</div>
2) includes/column_right.php
	Delete these two comments and everything between:
	
	//start: Section to delete to covert this site to right column only. 
	//end: Section to delete to covert this site to right column only. 
	
3)css/styles.css
	delete these two selectors:
		#right-column-only{
		display: none;
		}
	
		#left-and-right, #column_left{
		display: none 
		}

IF USING THE SITE WITH BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT COLUMNS
4 STEPS:
