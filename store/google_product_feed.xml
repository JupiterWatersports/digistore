<g:price>1399.9900</g:price>
<description>
Highly responsive for prone surf, wing, wake foiling and SUP surf/downwinding.&#160; Development &#8220;As the sport develops, riders push themselves and the equipment to the limits. After listening to feedback, we wanted to develop a new, innovative, ultra high-performance mast that minimizes drag and ventilation while also being stiffer and even more responsive.&#8221;&#160;- Armie Armstrong Collaborating with a team of America&#8217;s Cup foil engineers, we set out to develop a high performance mast to take us into the future. Our design goal called for a unique blend of strength, stiffness, drag and light weight. Combining CFD analysis with expert insight allowed us to tune each section of the mast from baseplate to fuselage connection for maximum efficiency. &#8220;Working with the latest premium composites available, we torture tested over 100 prototypes to work out the optimal fiber orientation for strength and designed flex. In keeping with our philosophy of strength and light weight, we redesigned the mast top geometry to shave off every possible extra gram of dead weight.&#8221;&#160;- Armie Armstrong Structural analysis shows that a combination of both high modulus (HM) and intermediate modulus (IM) carbon fibers best distributes loads throughout various sections of the mast. HM&#39;s stiffness minimizes flex in the mast&#39;s central strut area and IM&#39;s high tensile strength caters to the complex shapes of the top plate and fuselage connection. The result is a top of the line mast consisting of top shelf materials, new mast section, refined baseplate, reduced drag fuselage connection and new construction method. Proprietary titanium M7 mast top hardware follows suit with a strong, light and drag reducing connection to the board. These masts are designed with a mast rake angle. This fine tunes the board angle relative to the foil for a more comfortable and forgiving ride. It does not change the lifting force or balance of the foil itself, and it does not impact the foil&#8217;s &#8220;foot pressure&#8221; bias front or back. Board rocker also directly determines effective mast rake &#8211; boards from different brands have a variety of different rocker lines which influence rake angle &#8211; and more rocker in the rear half of board effectively increases mast rake.&#160;The 1 degree of rake we&#8217;ve placed specifically into the top of the Performance Mast shape provides three main benefits by adjusting the board relative to the foil underwater: By bringing the foil closer to 0 degrees when the board is in the water, drag is reduced which makes takeoffs easier. Touching down at speed or landing a jump is more forgiving and there&#8217;s less chance of crashing headfirst over the board. By lifting the board nose slightly (1 degree = 17.46mm/m), mast rake makes it easier to ride fast without catching the nose at steep riding angles. Simply put, the Performance Mast range takes the sublime Armstrong feeling further than ever.

Armstrong Step 1 Foils Redefining how we learn to foil, the Step 1 (S1) foil range delivers remarkable stability, ultra low flying speed and an instantly intuitive feel to make the first step into foiling as accessible and forgiving as possible. Pitch, roll and yaw stability are critical to success when building foiling skills. The S1 design achieves a near autopilot-like level of predictability thanks to a combination of leading and trailing edge sweep, chord length and foil section geometry. The result is an ultra easy platform for first time flyers to learn any foiling discipline. The S1 foils fly at a remarkably low speed with a high degree of controllability so that riders can practise manoeuvres with less risk and a lower learning curve. When overpowered, the foil reduces breaching with a tendency to fly itself back down when approaching the surface. Because these foils handle speed and ventilation so well, riders can enjoy an exceptionally broad usable speed range in each size. Downturned wingtips provide an extra element of safety. Built to the same tolerances as our other foils, the S1 range is constructed from carbon composites which provide an excellent strength to weight ratio. Details: &#8226; An ultra easy platform for first time flyers to learn any foiling discipline. Excellent low speed lift, stability and recovery from ventilation. &#8226; Leading and trailing edge sweep for stability and a narrower span to minimise breaching. &#8226; Downturned wing tips increase rider safety and improve the efficiency of water flow. &#8226; Proprietary Armstrong A+ System foil connection design offers industry-leading stiffness, durability and modularity. &#8226; The S1 300 stabiliser was designed alongside the S1 foils to provide riders with the best learning platform possible. Tech Specs: 1250cm2: Span 848mm, Aspect Ratio 5.7 1550cm2: Span 905mm, Aspect Ratio 5.3 1850cm2: Span 965mm, Aspect Ratio 5.0 2450cm2: Span 1054mm, Aspect Ratio 4.8 300cm2 stabiliser: Span 410mm, Aspect Ratio 5.7 Armstrong Alloy System The Armstrong Alloy System was designed to enable riders of all skill levels to chase endless experiences on the water. Its modularity, broad performance range and exceptional build quality empowers riders of all levels to progress without limits. Modularity is core to the Alloy System design. It&#8217;s fully compatible with all our front foils and stabilisers so as riders&#8217; style evolves, so can their setup. Building on the knowledge and technology that led to our industry-leading carbon Performance Mast, the AA mast shape and structure are optimised from top to bottom for an excellent balance of efficiency and strength. This approach to design and attention to detail is exemplified in the Alloy System&#8217;s specially machined mast top and SailGP-inspired bottom bracket that are crafted from aerospace-grade aluminium alloys. The system is outfitted exclusively with premium titanium and surgical stainless hardware for a light and highly corrosion resistant setup that&#8217;s durable over time. Industry-leading manufacturing tolerances make for a high performance, beautiful fit and finish overall. Details: &#8226; Hexagonal fuselage shape is inherently strong, stiff and modular for an easy front foil swap. &#8226; The mast section is 17.5mm thick; efficient through the water, yet strong to withstand the loads of advanced riding. &#8226; Aircraft-grade 6061 and 7075 alloys for excellent strength to weight ratio. &#8226; Titanium and stainless hardware save having to disassemble frequently so it&#8217;s easy to use and maintain with excellent corrosion resistance. Screws are custom-made M7 and M8 x 1.25. Tech Specs: &#8226; 85cm (33.5&#8221;), 72cm (28.5&#8221;), 58cm (22.5&#8221;) mast lengths &#8226; 75cm, 65cm fuselage lengths &#160;</description>

Redefining the inflatable foilboard, the Seek Air delivers the feel and nbsp;performance of its hybrid carbon counterpart with all the lightweight convenience, portability, and durability of an inflatable. Designed with forgiving performance rails and a sharp release tail for effortless take-offs and touchdown&#160;recovery, the Seek Air features our unique Carbon Sandwich Transfer (CST) base with DropBox fast foil mounting. The CST base is designed for the most direct and responsive connection to the foil. It is engineered with a slight curve to match the rocker of the board, for outstanding control and pumpability. Surprisingly light with a low swing weight, the smaller Seek Air have a high-performance feel, while the larger sizes are refined for on-water speed and fast, early take offs - making them ideal for learning to foil. The larger two sizes are supplied with removable side fins, so you can focus on winging, before adding a foil. Durable, impact absorbing and ding resistant, we&#39;re confident the Seek Air will become a firm favourite (for you and the family) at home, on the boat and on holiday for many years to come. Each board features v-strap and centreline foot strap inserts integrated into the intuitive contoured deckpad, and is supplied in a travel-friendly Go Green recycled PET backpack with roller wheels, two-way inflation pump and foil mounting hardware. Maximum stiffness guaranteed (up to 15PSI Inflation Pressure). To find your ideal volume/board size for winging, add +30-40 litres for novice rider or +10-20 litres for intermediate to your rider weight (kg).</description>

<title>North Sonar SF830 Front Wing</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=10439</link>
<g:price>619.0000</g:price>
<description>
DESCRIPTION [Arrow icon] We&#8217;ve engineered our Sonar Surf Series for super low stall speeds, effortless pumping and surf-style carving. Ideal for riders wanting more from surf and downwind swells (with or without a wing). The foil&#8217;s insensitivity to angle of attack change means you don&#8217;t have&#160;to be an expert or have perfect pumping technique. A refined balance of roll stability and manoeuvrability gives you confidence during pumping and take-offs, and the ability to initiate powerful rail-to-rail carves. Push it harder, lip stall and lay down banking turns, knowing tip ventilation is a thing of the past. Reduced distance between the mast and front wing makes for faster, tighter pivoting turns. We&#8217;ve kept the span similar between the three sizes, providing the same ride feel across the entire size range. The SF promises a frictionless sensation of glide at slower speeds. Responsive and agile. With intuitive recovery. Wakesurfing ten waves back, prone-surfing, wing-surfing, pumping or mastering the downwind. The Sonar SF Series. At one, with it all.</description>

DESCRIPTION [Arrow icon] The S215 Surf stabilizer has a lower stall to complement the SF Front Wings. Its moderate span creates an aspect ratio high enough for efficient pumping, while remaining compact for responsiveness in turns?. The minimal sweep outline improves low-speed performance and effectively reduces&#160;fuselage length compared to swept stabilizers?. Tips curve upwards to provide directional stability, inspiring confidence during takeoffs and grip in turns. ?Advanced riders seeking a looser feel may choose to remove the wingtips, using the dashed guideline graphic, to create a completely flat stabilizer with a 205cm2 area.</description>

<g:price>820.0000</g:price>
<description>
DESIGNED BY JOHN AKERMAN Supporting aggressive skim style riding, the Phase Five MVP Wakesurfer harnesses unique features not found anywhere else in our lineup. First you will notice a full decked Techno Traction V2 EVA grip pad with nose kick tail support for superior foot control. John&#8217;s idea for a kick tail in the nose was to gain more leverage to execute tricks while riding revert. The MVP is the only board with our RidgeGrip technology, a unique rail design inspired by his direct feedback. RidgeGrip stiffens the board and offers a pronounced spot to grab when executing tricks above the lip. The moon tail design and V-Spline bottom contours deliver maximum speed and handling. It is made with Gatorskin to take a beating and built with a single fin setup loaded with our 1&#8221; Skim Fin.</description>

We recruited the world&#8217;s leading wing and kite designers to push this shape to the next level. Each aspect of the new A-Wing XPS was tirelessly thought out, tested and finely tuned in a wide range of riding conditions.&#160; An innovative cross panel sail (XPS) design provides an outstanding level of connection when riding. This futuristic panel layout greatly reduces sail distortion by improving load distribution and frame rigidity. This gives all the wing sizes a very direct and controlled feel for easy and comfortable flying. Removable carbon fibre battens minimise trailing edge flutter and provide easy canopy tuning for varying wind strengths. The XPS&#8217;s airfoil section combined with our pre-twist tip geometry produces incredible speed with sublime upwind performance. This greatly benefits jump amplitude for freestyle manoeuvres and delivers plenty of hang time and float&#160;for smooth landings. This wing is also a wave rider&#8217;s dream with little to no luffing or sail flutter and excellent stability, allowing the rider to focus less on the wing and more on shredding the wave. A newly developed hybrid carbon handle (HCH) design has a rigid carbon interior skeleton and soft padded exterior. This combination offers the best balance of control, comfort and safety. We tested hundreds of individual materials during the development of the XPS. We settled on the new generation high quality lightweight Dacron, tried and tested polyester Dacron and Ultra PE woven laminate (ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene) for key reinforcements. The result is a highly refined combination of materials which delivers impressive strength to weight, durability and overall performance.</description>

<title>2021 Ocean Rodeo Glide HL Series</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=8816</link>
<g:price>564.5000</g:price>
<description>
Coming straight off the back of the Crave HL-Series kites&#8217; incredible success, it was a no-brainer that our wings would bypass a traditional, industry-standard Dacron build and instead utilize the innovative Hybrid Light system. Strategically placed ALUULA composite materials are blended with Dacron to create this new hybrid construction class that delivers an impressive decrease in weight with improved airframe response. ALUULA has been inserted into key overlays and reinforcements throughout the wing, while the strut is composed entirely from ALUULA composite material. The full ALUULA strut reduces airframe flex while keeping the centre of gravity forward, resulting in superior handling. Every Ocean Rodeo Glide wing is fitted with our interchangeable Matrix handle system. Wings come with the Matrix handles pre-installed, yet allow the rider to customize handles and positions at their preference.&#160;&#160; With the HL-Series wings, we didn&#8217;t just stop with the implementation of ALUULA... Every single seam and component was reviewed and precision tuned. If any weight savings could be found, we addressed them, while at the same time maintaining our 20-year legacy of producing &#8220;Built Tough&#8221; products. WHY ALUULA? A lighter Wing means a better handling in all conditions. &#160; ALUULA, an ultra-light, ultra-strong and stable composite material, not only improves light wind performance but also increases handling, stability and flying performance in all wind conditions. This makes an ALUULA wing more efficient than a standard wing, performing better in all respects, including improved flex for more reactive pumping, lighter weight for easy hand work, and ultra light for balanced one handed drifting.&#160; &#160; &#160; Why do you need the lightest Wings on the market? Better for all styles of riding. Downwinders, surf, freestyle and more. With improved response in all conditions, you&#8217;ll enjoy easier transitions, better light wind and enhanced top end control due reduced distortion in gusts delivered by the stretch resistant ALUULA. Better wind range. Every Ocean Rodeo Wing features the full ALUULA strut. Built to withstand 12 psi this high pressure strut connects your input directly to the leading edge and canopy without delay or distortion. Better for travel. When two A-Series wings weigh the same as one traditional wing, it&#8217;s a no-brainer&#8230;carry more gear on your trips with less fear of excess baggage charges.&#160;</description>

Glide AA-Series Discipline: All Around - Surf / Freestyle / Race &#160; New for 2023, the Glide AA is our first all ALUULA composite wing and the launch pad for new ALUULA technologies: Aeris and Aeris X airframe and canopy materials. &#160; 86gsm Aeris X delivers outstanding stiffness to the center of the leading edge and strut tube, while 74gsm Aeris provides the desired wing tip reflex. &#160; Light, stiff and durable,&#160;46gsm Aeris X canopy extends the upper and lower wind range of each size, while taking canopy tear resistance to a new level. &#160; The combination of these technological upgrades results in a wing that is exceptionally stable, lightweight and user-friendly. This advanced wing allows you to concentrate on your riding experience without being hindered by any drawbacks typically associated with traditional wings. &#160; The Glide AA is compatible with all Ocean Rodeo Matrix wing handles and comes with the new Quick Click Wing Leash - a self aligning connector pin makes clicking in and out a one-handed operation. &#160; Recycle-ready -&#160;The ALUULA Aeris and Aeris X materials used for the airframe and canopy in the Glide AA-Series are recyclable at the end of their useful life.</description>

<title>2023 Duotone Slick</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=10165</link>
<g:price>743.2000</g:price>
<description>
Description The Slick is our latest Freeride &amp; Freestyle Wing featuring the Mini Boom - designed to enhance your flying experience with increased lift, power, and hang time. The Slick boasts exceptional stability and balance, allowing for a smooth ride through gusts and lulls. The new version of Duotone&#39;s Mini Boom Wing was crafted with a clear objective - to amplify power while expanding the wind range and increasing the sweet spot. Not only does it provide more lift for jumps and Freestyle tricks, but it also will have you flying on the foil with minimal pumping, making a huge difference in light winds and for less experienced riders. The MOD3 canopy makes a significant impact on the wing&#39;s performance, enhancing its grunt, low-end power, and direct response due to its low stretch characteristics. The higher modulus fabric and construction details ensure that the Slick&#8217;s shape and profile remain, even in strong gusts, resulting in rapid acceleration without the need for hand placement or riding position adjustments. Furthermore, the MOD3 canopy improves the wing&#39;s longevity and durability. The deeper profile enhances the lift and makes for a smoother power delivery and provides a forgiving ride feel making it easy and intuitive for riders with varying experience and different wind conditions. This feature enhances the learning curve for beginners, enabling them to master the basics quickly. Additionally, the constant and predictable pull makes it easier to execute freestyle tricks and rotational jumps with ease. The Slick&#39;s refined strut flex and wing tip angles ensure consistent power delivery and a smooth and consistent ride through gusts. Two well-placed windows on each side of the wing provide good visibility, so you never have a blind spot, without compromising the wing&#39;s lightweight feel. With three Mini Boom options, from the Aluminum Silver, to the Platinum and Platinum SLS in Carbon, there&#8217;s an ideal option for every rider. The Slick Mini Boom is also backwards-compatible with our previous generation of Slick Wings. The 2023 Slick flags out and steers exceptionally effortless when held by the refined front handle and remains neutral and balanced in the surf or when going downwind. That being said - the Slicks infinite options in hand placement make it the ideal choice for both Freestylers and Freeriders alike. It offers unrivaled benefits and rapid progression for those learning maneuvers and tricks.</description>

<description>
Backline trim&#8217;s new standard. Our iconic Shift bar is suitable for all riding styles, and is particularly popular amongst wave riders and freeriders. Entering its 4th year in production, and fast becoming the future standard of kite control, the Shift has a backline trim that provides reliable and seamless power adjustment, all within easy reach, and without having to take your eyes off the water. Further new refinements include a reduced diameter grip, resulting in a more direct and tactile feel between the kite and bar. The diamond grip texture has also been refined, making it less aggressive on the hands while still delivering exceptional grip for all riding styles and in varying environmental temperatures. Other new features include crank stops at the tips of both bar floats, and further refined gearing in the pawl winder assembly for precision trim control every time. The Shift outfits with the new Gen 9 Punch Out Trim Loop and freeride Leash. ISO 21853 compliant, the new trim loop and leash are loaded with exciting new features to enhance your ride while delivering reliable release and depower flag out.

<title>North Sonar S208 Stabilizer</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=10436</link>
<g:price>179.0000</g:price>
<description>
&#160; DESCRIPTION Flat, loose and fast, the new S208 Stabilizer is another high performance upgrade to the Sonar Foil System for experienced riders. The S208 has a higher aspect ratio than the S210, which means less drag, and the flatter rondure (front view) enables more&#160;manoeuvrability. As we&#8217;ve increased our front wing range, we&#8217;ve needed to match the lift force of the front wing with the stabilizer. While your front wing creates vertical lift, your stabilizer has a downward acting force, which prevents the front wing from nose-diving. A larger stabilizer translates into more front foot pressure, while a smaller stabilizer equals less front foot pressure. The North stabs are mounted on top of the fuselage, which helps them to avoid turbulence from the flow of the front wing, creating a smoother ride. This top mounting also gives the rider an early breach warning - the stab pierces the water surface first, giving you a better chance of recovery before your front wing gets too high. Like the Front Wings, all Sonar Stabilizers are pre-preg carbon construction, ensuring optimal stiffness and direct performance. The thin profile section reduces drag, while the material properties help maintain structural integrity and rigidity. Stabs have a huge influence on performance. As you progress to smaller wing sizes, we recommend changing to a smaller stabilizer to be more manoeuvrable. Experienced riders will really feel the difference. A new tail can have a big impact on your style</description>

<g:price>649.0000</g:price>
<description>
DESCRIPTION We&#8217;ve engineered our Sonar Surf Series for super low stall speeds, effortless pumping and surf-style carving. Ideal for riders wanting more from surf and downwind swells (with or without a wing). The foils insensitivity to angle of attack change forgiveness means you don&#8217;t&#160;have to be an expert or have perfect pumping technique. A refined balance of roll stability and manoeuvrability gives you confidence during pumping and take-offs, and the ability to initiate powerful rail-to-rail carves. Push it harder, lip stall and lay down banking turns, knowing tip ventilation is a thing of the past. Reduced distance between the mast and front wing makes for faster, tighter pivoting turns. We&#8217;ve kept the span similar between the three sizes, providing the same ride feel across the entire size range. The SF promises that frictionless sensation of glide at slower speeds. Responsive and agile. With intuitive recovery. Wakesurfing ten waves back, prone-surfing, wing-surfing, pumping or mastering the downwind. The Sonar SF Series. At one, with it all</description>

Go-Joe The Go-Joe is in use in schools world wide and is the only board recovery device officially endorsed and promoted by both the IKO and PASA, the world&#8217;s two largest kiteboard instructor certification bodies. &#160; Designed to sit unobtrusively between your feet on the board, you won&#8217;t even notice the Go-Joe when riding. However, lose your board and the Go-Joe&#8217;s inflated body will flip your board over for you and catch the wind, sailing the board down wind so that it is never far from you after a crash or hard landing.</description>

Surfboard ideal for surfing big waves down the line Do you find nothing more beautiful than ripping the most beautiful waves from home and abroad completely to pieces? This board makes it possible to keep control on even the fastest and steepest. Because the comp has a lot of rocker and a narrow tail you have unprecedented control and you can turn top to bottom with complete confidence like you&quot;ve never done before! Because this board has a longer nose, you can look at the size at a board that is 4 &quot;longer than what you would choose with an AMP. The concave that runs from single to double along the length of the board makes it easy to handle in the chop. The Carbon innegra construction is the lightest performance construction on the market. Because there is less flex, the board is even faster and more precise than the wood sandwich construction. The unique carbon innegra construction has an extremely light core and a super sturdy PET exterior. Do you want to rip hard on the thickest waves and have the most control of everyone, then this is the board with which you can throw the highest spray off the lip!

<description>
ARRIVE END OF MAY!! INSPIRED BY THE SOUL OF SURFING The Midlength is more than a board, it&#39;s an approach: It&#39;s the unconventional idea that in a world hellbent on giving you so many choices that you can hardly pick what to take out for a session, doing more with less is an inspiring alternative. True to its surf-inspired name, the new Midlength board range truly redefines when and how you can go foiling. It&#39;s the ace up your sleeve, the session saver, hell, it&#39;s a fast-paddling, rippable flight time booster that&#39;s your new superpower. It gives you the freedom to define how you ride. The choice is yours. THE SWEET SPOT A uniquely happy medium. Slotting in between our Prone, Wing and Downwind boards, the Midlength is a session saver on small or light days with excellent paddle power and an easy release to get you up on foil. That speed and efficiency work equally well to boost your confidence when hunting down bigger surf; the Midlength paddles like a rhino chaser that transforms into your shortboard once in flight. Forget choosing the perfect board, just get on the water and let the board melt away as you take in everything else. A goldilocks ratio of dimensions and volume makes for optimum glide, stability and maneuverability so you don&#39;t need to be a pro to up your time on foil. FROM THE SHAPING BAY Outline:&#160;A pointed but not overly sharp nose, gently tapering midsection and pulled in tail make for an efficient glider for prone paddling into either small or large surf. That glide translates remarkably well when winging, too - the Midlength is an amazing light wind machine that rockets off the water with nearly the ease of a Downwind board. Rocker and rails:&#160;Progressive rocker from the nose to the foil tracks keeps things lively in the pocket and makes touchdown recovery easier, and tail kick out the back makes for easy pumping and a clean release on launch. Soft rails up front progress into harder lines out the back for efficient flow and balanced on-water tracking and responsiveness. Bottom:&#160;Pulling from the Downwind boards, a subtle double concave at the nose works its way flat at the foil tracks and finally into the diamond-V tail shape for a quick pop up and maximum un-stickiness when touching down. If a board ever wanted to stay in the air, this would be it. MORE GRIP. MORE CONTROL. MORE SOUL. Redefine your footwork. Like the deck grip on Armstrong&#39;s Wing FG and DW foilboards, the Midlength&#8217;s deck grip is tailored specifically to provide you with maximum control and comfort to enable your style across different foil sports. In conjunction with the Midlength&#8217;s flat deck, the grip features raised central arch bars above the foil tracks and elevated wedges in the rear of the pad for intuitive and unrestricted foot placement when soul carving across a wave face or getting creative with your foot placement when winging. FORWARD GEOMETRY Limitless options to fasttrack your progression. Emphasising modularity within board design, Armstrong introduced a major innovation to wing boards in 2021 with the Forward Geometry concept. Designed to work with any brand of foil, the FG design increases responsiveness by placing the foil more centrally and reducing swing weight in turns. The ML board range carries on that design legacy with FG foil tracks that are strategically placed well forward for maximum manoeuvrability and a hyper connected feel on foil, delivering high performance to riders on all the board sizes.</description>

From CORE More performance, lower carbon footprint PERFORMANCE FREERIDE + | FREESTYLE | BIG AIR MASTER EVERY CHALLENGE CORE&#8217;s bestselling twintip - now featuring the remarkably efficient Cartan 2 carbon fiber weave. An innovative, holistic board that meets all the requirements of the aspiring rider. Its unique materials and technology, packed in a sophisticated shape with highly differentiated underwater hull, make it the ideal board for all types of riders, excelling in all disciplines. Minimally stiffer and maximally stronger. The Fusion 6th generation builds upon the innovation of the legendary CARVED Imperator, introducing for the first time the lighter, more powerful, and sustainable Cartan 2 Carbon. With its reduced layer thickness, this carbon lies flat on the wood core, resulting in lower resin usage and increased efficiency in terms of stiffness and strength. The formula is simple: higher fiber content in the laminate translates to less material, allowing for higher and faster restoring forces, ultimately delivering superior performance. Smaller ecological footprint. As a manufacturer, we prioritize our responsibility to enhance the sustainability of our production and supply chains. Introducing The GreenPoxy, an epoxy resin with 35% of its molecular structure derived from plants we can ensure a significant enviromental contribution without compromising its function and performance. Additionally, our switch to Cartan 2, has resulted in a reduction of cutting waste by up to 80%. Master every challenge. Take your skills to the next level. Try the Fusion 6 now. Key Features: NEW CARTAN&#174; 2 CARBON:&#160;Thinner, stronger carbon fibre fabric with 80% less cutting waste UNIBODY EDGE:&#160;the best connection of deck and hull PAULOWNIA LIGHT:&#160;even lighter wood core with the same strength NEW GREENPOXY:&#160;35% epoxy resin of plant origin MULTI CHANNELS:&#160;grip and control in all situations KATANA CHANNELS:&#160;stiffer tips for increased response and restoring force V-SHAPED KEEL:&#160;early gliding, buttery soft landings BEVELED DECK:&#160;minimized reverse flex and better planning VEE ROCKER:&#160;fast without the risk of diving TUCKED UNDER RAILS:&#160;more grip and more effective gain in height NEW EQ FIN SET (48MM):&#160;equal grip, more agility Developed, tested and refined over three years. The completely redesigned EQ fin not only looks exceptional, it performs exceptionally. With a wide fin base resembling a beluga forehead, it effectively prevents water from being sucked in. Unlike standard fins, the grip level of EQ fins remains consistent as speed increases, offering a distinct advantage. This feature noticeably facilitates easier release even at full speed, allowing for smoother switching. Additionally, the rounded transition between the fin and board minimizes drag, which occurs when two surfaces meet. The EQ fin is also designed to be lightweight, weighing approximately 30 percent less than the Equalizer fin, thanks to its hollow interior. The rough surface is not just an unclean finish, but the technical icing on the cake: in turbulent currents, the precisely defined roughness minimizes suction and increases maneuverability. Package Includes: Board 48mm Fins Handle</description>

THE ERA OF PROGRESSION A board that sets the bar for innovation and sustainability. Designed for the joy of freeriding and riders of all levels, the Era transforms your first rides into unforgettable experiences and unlocks advanced moves effortlessly. With progression at its core, this board is your ticket to pushing boundaries with confidence and style. Smooth rides guaranteed Chop, flat, you name it. With a strikingly wide keel, this board achieves a pleasantly smooth ride. The curved channels give the board an extremely good glide and great upwind characteristics. With its parabolic outline, splashing water is effectively reduced and playful carving properties are achieved. The heart of the Era lies in its Paulownia wood core, cocooned within innovative and sustainable basalt fabric. Crafted from natural volcanic rock, basalt is processed into continuous textile fibers. This unique material not only provides exceptional cushioning but also ensures remarkable take-off performance. Paired with our Greenpoxy&#174; resin, boasting a 35 percent plant-based composition, the Era marks a breakthrough in eco-friendly board design. Key Features: BASALT FABRIC: naturally efficient, durable and powerful The top-tier performance and maximum durability come directly from the fabric used in the Era. The fabric is extracted from basalt - a natural volcanic effusion. Like glass fibers, basalt can be processed at high temperatures into continuous textile fibers, which boast higher tensile strength, compressive strength, and stiffness. The result? Outstanding cushioning and explosive bounce potential. This means that you will experience a smoother and more comfortable ride. Furthermore, both energy consumption and CO2 emissions from production are significantly lower than that of glass and carbon fibers. PAULOWNIA LIGHT: lightweight wood core with high strength We meticulously select Paulownia rod slats with the lowest weight and expertly bond them together to create a dynamic and high-performance core. This careful selection process allows us to reduce the specific gravity of the core by an impressive 21 percent, resulting in up to 250 grams of weight reduction without compromising strength. GREENPOXY&#174;: composed of 35 percent plant-based molecules Both the Era and Fusion are coated with GreenPoxy 33, an epoxy resin composed of 35 percent plant-based molecules&#8212;a cutting-edge advancement in bio-based chemistry. Extensive testing across various CORE prototypes over several years has consistently demonstrated the resin&#39;s superior quality and performance. This confirmed our decision to go this more expensive but more environmentally friendly route. SLIM OUTLINE: smooth running and plenty of grip The Era&#39;s unique parabolic outline is a game-changer in kitesurfing design. The deliberately slimmed tip width ensures effortless handling while generating a harmonious ride experience with unmatched grip during gliding jibes and turns. Compared to Fusion and Choice models, the Era demands only basic rider skills, thanks to its slightly smaller tip width. Plus, the concave at the board&#39;s end enhances edge grip while adding a touch of flair with a subtle spray effect. CHANNELED MULTI-CONCAVE: effortless upwind glide The concaves and channels come in a very special arrangement. Proven in flow analyses, the water currents are directed in optimized directions underneath the Era. This leads to extremely good glide and upwind properties. VOLUMINOUS CENTER KEEL: low water resistance Based on the &quot;Bulbous Bow&quot; from modern shipbuilding, the Era has been given a strikingly wide keel, which also influences the flow patterns in a targeted manner and reduces water resistance. In addition, it effectively breaks the surface tension of the water, which contributes to superior handling, especially in chop. DOME DECK: sporty ride and massive pop The concave of the underwater hull is also depicted in the deck. This controls the board flex of the Era and increases stiffness, especially in the middle. For example, the reverse flex can be reduced during hard edging as well as after flat landings, which contributes to sporty handling and massive Pop. VEE ROCKER: speed on demand For the optimal setup, the Era has three rocker lines matched to the board size. At the same time, the concept of the Vee rocker was retained and refined accordingly. The bend is most pronounced in the center of the board and decreases towards the tips. Due to the maximum bend in the center, the board is fast and protrudes far enough out of the water to minimize splashing water and eliminate fin catching. EQ FIN SET (48MM): plenty of grip and agility The Era&#39;s wide fin base, resembling a Beluga&#39;s profile at the front, effectively prevents water soaking. Unlike standard fins, speed doesn&#39;t compromise grip, making it easy to switch even at full speed. The rounded transition between fin and board reduces drag at surface junctions. The hollow EQ fin is 30 percent lighter than the equalizer fin, enhancing agility. The rough surface is also the technical icing on the cake: in turbulent flows, the precisely defined roughness further minimizes suction and increases mobility.

ONE BOARD, ALL CONDITIONS The world&#8217;s most Winning board in all conditions. From entry level riders, to elite racers; the All Star has claimed countless victories in international and world championship races. The All Star is the board of choice for all conditions, and is the most versatile race design. FEATURES Stability&#160;&#8211; Refined vee design underneath the board has proven to be the most efficient and stable All Star concept to date. EVA Race Deflector&#160;&#8211; Designed for larger ocean chop, the deflector diverts water from entering the standing area. NEW&#160;Open Cockpit Design&#160;&#8211; Volume refinements to the All Star reduce weight. The front of the cockpit has been reduced to save weight and give the rider more room in the standing area. NEW&#160;Round Tail Design&#160;&#8211; Creates better hydrodynamic flow at the tail, for less wash and a faster gliding board. NEW&#160;Trimmed Inner Deck&#160;&#8211;&#160;The slope of the standing area has been tuned for comfortable standing in downwind and better water release when turning, and has further reduced volume for a great weight saving. Multiple Handle Positions&#160;&#8211;&#160;Customisable handle positions for beach starts. NEW&#160;Recessed Scupper Center Drainage&#160;&#8211; All new scupper drainage systems are integrated into the board, featuring a much larger drainage opening for faster drainage. NEW&#160;10&#8221; Fin Box&#160;&#8211;&#160;Gives riders flexibility to adjust their fin depending on race style. NEW&#160;Soft Rounded Rails&#160;&#8211;&#160;Our most stable and easy to use rail shape gives you complete control in all conditions. High Side Wall&#160;&#8211; For the best performance in chop, the high walls gives you control in choppier conditions while limiting water from coming into the standing area. Amazing stability is achieved by a low, recessed standing area &#8211; allowing you to paddle on narrower sizes with ease. Carbon Fins&#160;&#8211;&#160;Ultra light carbon fins are included with the All Star. Flash is our fastest and most maneuverable racing fin, available on narrower sizes for All Star. Flash+ features larger surface area for increased stability. Versatility&#160;&#8211;&#160;The All Star is the proven most versatile board ever. Winning dozens of ICF World Titles in Flatwater Sprints, Technical Racing and Distance Events. Vee Tail&#160;&#8211; Assisting in tracking and control, the tail vee gives you complete control in flatwater and in surf, aiding in better release. &#160; VOLUME = 321 L &#160;</description>

More Performance, More Stability, More Waves 10 x CLIMATE POSITIVE The Wide Ride range features great surf &#8216;n cruise paddle boards that are designed to be floaty, fun, and the king of catching waves. This range is ideally suited for those getting started in SUP surfing and is great for the whole family to have fun with while learning the sport. You&#8217;ll make any kind of mush highly surfable with this shape. Wide Ride has a surf &#8216;n cruise paddle board size for all rider weights and abilities; the bigger models produce the easiest glide and stability, while the smaller sizes deliver more control and manoeuvrability. Wide Ride: the wave-ripper for real-world riders! THE WIDE RIDE WITH REAL GLIDE THIN RAILS ON WIDE BOARDS You will sense the trademark thin rails biting into the wave just like a smaller board and let you maneuver off the top and in bottom turns in ways not expected. The thin rails mean you need less e ort to turn on the rail, as there is less volume holding the board back from sinking into the turn. SHORT NOSE OUTLINE Makes it easier to pivot turn and fit in the critical section of the wave without catching the nose. &#160; NOSE KICK Prevents the nose from diving when getting into waves and paddling in choppy water. &#160; FLAT ROCKER In the center provides efficient glide and speed on flats. &#160; FLAT STANDING AREA Allows to have a wider stance for extra stability in chop. &#160; MODERATE TAIL KICK Allows for tighter turning when standing back on the tail. &#160; WIDE ROUNDED TAIL Improves stability when stepping on the board to turn. It also gives release out of turns. &#160; MONO TO DOUBLE CONCAVE BOTTOM Provides speed to catch the wave and then has sensitive rail-to-rail turning from the midpoint. &#160; CHANNEL TAIL Makes it easier to carry speed and hold through maneuverers. &#160; SIDE FIN BOXES Are positioned closer to the rail for quicker response in turns. Minimal change yet a big improvement. &#160; FIN SET UP Thruster fin set up provides comfortable straight-line tracking on flat and gives drive and control in surf. Pocket Rocket allows both thruster and quad set up. Quad fin set up uses 4 side fins and gives fast acceleration and instant down the line speed as it does not have a drag from the larger centre fin. CONSTRUCTION: LITE TECH LIGHT, STRONG, AFFORDABLE &#8226; Extra rigidity with the introduction of unidirectional stringer bands and solid with added rail / nose reinforcements. &#8226; Australian pine on the standing area for extra impact resistance and rigidity in the most critical area. &#8226; All inserts have added high-density foam reinforcements.

<title>CORE PUMP 2.0</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=8268</link>
<g:price>74.9500</g:price>
<description>
The CORE Pump 2.0 is re-invented and offered in two size, L or XL! Although our shiny new black pump features a longer barrel, ergonomic hand grips, a fatter hose and a redesigned base, its biggest innovation hides inside. Internal pump friction is virtually eliminated and our &#8220;Sand Guard&#8221; air filter prevents internal kite damage from sand inhalation. Although our kites do not need an adapter, we included one anyways for those &#8220;other&#8221; kites. Check out the innovations we built into this pump: NO STRAIN PUMPING Save your energy for the water. Innovative materials, seals and piston coatings have virtually created a frictionless pump. We even increased the diameter of the hose outlet to increase airflow and reduce pump strain. SAND GUARD Sand belongs on the beach, not in your kite. So we built a foam air inlet filter into the handle. Why, you ask? To prevent sneaky sand from damaging your kite bladders and reducing pump efficiency. SINGLE TO DOUBLE STROKE INFLATION SWITCH More pressure with the turn of a knob. The last few pumps are always the hardest with a 2 way pump. So we decided to give you the option to switch from traditional double stroke to single stroke pumping for the last bit of air. DIGITALLY CALIBRATED PRESSURE GAUGE Perfect pressure every time without guessing. The new digitally calibrated pressure gauge has a simple colour coded scale to make precise inflation a breeze. LONGER BARREL, LONGER STROKE FOR MORE AIR VOLUME We extended the barrel a few centimeters from the previous model to provide a more upright pumping posture. The additional length also increases pump volume with each stroke. Your back will thank you. ERGONOMIC GRIPS Our longer, wider ergonomic grips make pumping a breeze. The grips contour to your palm and fingers so you can leverage your body weight without leaving marks. &#160; HEAVY DUTY PUMP TETHER WITH A NIFTY HOOK Pumps are often neglected. So we built our new CORE Pump 2.0 to last. We even doubled the thickness of the tether and installed an oversized hook. Because we understand. &#160;</description>

&#160; Downwind SUP foiling is part of the Armstrong DNA. As a pioneer in the sport, Armie introduced downwind SUP foiling to the 2016 Gorge Paddle Challenge, 2017 Na Pali coast race and the 2018 Molokai2Oahu race with other early innovators of DW foiling. Our new DW board range combines this historical passion and motivation with our latest design knowledge. Sleek lines, innovative volume distribution and state of the art construction help create a range of boards that are fast, stiff, light and easy to get on foil. Five sizes make sure that everyone who wants to sample the DW stoke is covered. The speed of these DW boards combined with their high volumes also makes them exceptional for light wind winging, SUP surf foiling and prone downwinding. FEATURES: High volume shape with a subtle deck recess for good feel and control while remaining easy to paddle. V nose to subtle double concave up to the foil boxes reduces drag on touch downs, and the pin tail acts like a fin for easy tracking when paddling. Round rails at front help accelerate the board into bumps. The shape of the bottom chines is inspired by our Performance mast foil section for efficient water release and zippy acceleration onto bumps.&#160; Length to width ratio is optimised across the range for glide when paddling without compromising stability.&#160; Stiff, lightweight carbon PVC innegra sandwich construction with industry leading double carbon sandwich stringer system for a direct connection to the foil. Proprietary custom carbon FG tracks for maximum strength, stiffness and durability.

CORE Vert Mast Carbon Masterpiece &#160; The new carbon mast forms the heart of the Vert foil system. Since maximum rigidity, endless glide and lowest resistances are elemental, the mast has been perfectly balanced to these properties. The carbon construction not only made the reduction of the width of the profile possible, but it also achieved a shallower depth towards the fuselage. And that&#39;s not all &#8211; our innovative sandwich construction, reinforced with a PMMI foam stringer, takes rigidity to a whole new level, giving you unmatched performance and confidence on the water. No compromises were made with the mast base either, it is connected directly to the mast and is created in one piece. This ensures immediate seamless transitions, direct power transmission and the lowest possible weight. &#160; All Vert products were developed on the basis of the Spectrum fuselage.

DESCRIPTION From Core The Spectrum gives the gift of perfect lift with balance and control, helping you explore the terrain and your abilities every session. Whether you want to ride in chop, waves or flat water, the predictable behavior, even in the most difficult conditions or turbulent sections, ensures you&#39;ll be soaring the playground further, faster and for longer. Features Each Spectrum front wing has a medium aspect-ratio for the ideal balance of performance and control, resulting in an extremely fluid feeling. As each size of wing in the Spectrum range narrows in thickness slightly differently from middle to tip, the angle-of-attack then turns negative towards the end of the tip; a proven technique in aviation to reduce drag and improve speed. Constructed with a multi-layer carbon laminate, the wings are not only light weight but also extremely durable. Package Includes Front Wing 3x M8x20mm Mounting Hardware Sold Separately</description>

More Performance, More Stability, More Waves 10 x CLIMATE POSITIVE &#160; The Wide Ride range features great surf &#8216;n cruise paddle boards that are designed to be floaty, fun, and the king of catching waves. This range is ideally suited for those getting started in SUP surfing and is great for the whole family to have fun with while learning the sport. You&#8217;ll make any kind of mush highly surfable with this shape. Wide Ride has a surf &#8216;n cruise paddle board size for all rider weights and abilities; the bigger models produce the easiest glide and stability, while the smaller sizes deliver more control and manoeuvrability. Wide Ride: the wave-ripper for real-world riders! THE WIDE RIDE WITH REAL GLIDE THIN RAILS ON WIDE BOARDS You will sense the trademark thin rails biting into the wave just like a smaller board and let you maneuver off the top and in bottom turns in ways not expected. &#160; The thin rails mean you need less e ort to turn on the rail, as there is less volume holding the board back from sinking into the turn. SHORT NOSE OUTLINE Makes it easier to pivot turn and fit in the critical section of the wave without catching the nose. &#160; &#160;NOSE KICK Prevents the nose from diving when getting into waves and paddling in choppy water. &#160; &#160;FLAT ROCKER In the center provides efficient glide and speed on flats. &#160; &#160;FLAT STANDING AREA Allows to have a wider stance for extra stability in chop. &#160; &#160;MODERATE TAIL KICK Allows for tighter turning when standing back on the tail. &#160; &#160;WIDE ROUNDED TAIL Improves stability when stepping on the board to turn. It also gives release out of turns. &#160; &#160;MONO TO DOUBLE CONCAVE BOTTOM Provides speed to catch the wave and then has sensitive rail-to-rail turning from the midpoint. &#160; &#160;CHANNEL TAIL Makes it easier to carry speed and hold through maneuverers. &#160; &#160;SIDE FIN BOXES Are positioned closer to the rail for quicker response in turns. Minimal change yet a big improvement. &#160; &#160;FIN SET UP Thruster fin set up provides comfortable straight-line tracking on flat and gives drive and control in surf. Pocket Rocket allows both thruster and quad set up. Quad fin set up uses 4 side fins and gives fast acceleration and instant down the line speed as it does not have a drag from the larger centre fin. CONSTRUCTION: LITE TECH LIGHT, STRONG, AFFORDABLE &#8226; Extra rigidity with the introduction of unidirectional stringer bands and solid with added rail / nose reinforcements. &#8226; Australian pine on the standing area for extra impact resistance and rigidity in the most critical area. &#8226; All inserts have added high-density foam reinforcements.

<title>2024 Starboard Ace Foil Downwind Board</title>

<g:price>1699.0000</g:price>
<description>
The Ace Foil is a fantastic crossover board for not only SUP downwinding, but light wind wingboarding as well as SUP surfing. Featuring: - Ace outline: The teardrop outline is the most efficient outline, offering even volume and a stable shape. - Narrow width:&#160;Designed for speed downwind and early takeoff. The aim of the Ace Foil is to offer a super-fast accelerating board to quickly catch bumps and accelerate quickly onto foil. - Pin tail:&#160;The pin tail offers great tracking for catching bumps, while the pin tail also brings the water back together, allowing a more efficient takeoff and touchdown with less board touching the water. - Round rails:&#160;The rounded rails were originally designed to be easy to use in choppy ocean conditions. This same concept has been brought to the Ace Foil model, which not only creates ease in the chop but also allows the board to have an amazing spring when pumping to get on the foil. - Rocker:&#160;The rocker is fine-tuned for speed, spring, and larger bumps. The rockerline has been tested in a range of conditions, from flat water to large ocean swell. Composition:&#160;Blue Carbon - Top grade 150g Biaxial Carbon wraps the entire board, joining with an overlap on the deck and bottom to create flat stringer, increasing the total breakage strength. -&#160;2 skins of durable fibre glass form a sandwich around the biaxial Carbon, protecting the carbon by dampening and absorbing the impact. -&#160;The combination of twin T-stringers deck and bottom work together to increase the overall total breakage strength. -&#160;Multiple reinforcements in the standing area, nose and tail increase impact resistance.</description>

The SLICE BAMBOO is a compact surf in a bamboo sandwich construction which does an excellent job of covering both strapless freestyle and small to medium-sized surfing. Planes with ease and pops excellently Super stable and fantastic edging Total control during airs Active and playful whilst surfing The compact format, the thin rails, the pronounced kick on the rocker and the profound channel on the bottom are the perfect attributes to strapless freestyle. The board offers a powerful natural pop, it is easy to maneuver in the air and the landings are soft and stable. With its fairly parallel outline, the SLICE planes with ease and its upwind abilities are remarkable. The SLICE BAMBOO is best suited to small and medium-sized waves and excels when the conditions are onshore and the waves aren&#8217;t too powerful. The board&#8217;s winged tail keeps the rail outline straight and fast, but allows the tail to be highly reactive for quick turn initiation. It also allows you to get the amplitude you need for freestyle. The SLICE BAMBOO is great for riders new to directional or those looking for stability practicing transitions. The SLICE BAMBOO has an efficient and reliable bamboo construction. The deck and bottom are built with bamboo sandwich construction to get a solid and light board using natural wood veneers. The deck receives a double bamboo layer in the feet area as extra reinforcement for durability. Equipped some foot strap inserts, the SLICE BAMBOO comes with a thruster fin set and the possibility to add a front pad as an option if desired.</description>

&#160; The &#8220;GT&#8221; stands for &#8220;Go To&#8221;. This series has the same outline and sizes as our very popular NL series. The GT Series is a dramatically more responsive, controlled and smooth performance foil. The GT has more pitch control which is the up and down movement you feel when riding. Controlling your pitch helps you go faster with more confidence. This series is so responsive to turns that you can get the wing tips out of the water and recover with more ease, while reducing over-foiling. The GT&#8217;s pump extremely well with solid initial lift and great low end. The low-end performance of the GT allows you to glide longer without dropping off foil. This series has a broad range that has low end and speed which allows you to ride a smaller foil and get the same performance. Dave Kalama uses the GT1250 for light wind downwind SUP and the GT1400 for really light wind downwind SUP. &#160; GT1250 Dimensions: Wingspan: 35&#8221;/ 89 cm Wing Chord: 7.25&#8221;/ 18.5 cm Projected Surface Area: 1250 sq cm Weight: 765 g Aspect ratio: 6.24 GT1400 Dimensions: Wingspan: 38&#8221;/ 96.5 cm Wing Chord: 7.25&#8221;/ 18.5 cm Projected Surface Area: 1400 sq cm Weight: 836 g Aspect ratio: 6.73 GT2200 Dimensions: Wingspan: 44&#8221;/ 112 cm Wing Chord: 10&#8221;/ 25.5 cm Projected Surface Area: 2200 sq cm Weight: 1247 g Aspect ratio: 5.74</description>

<description>
The Mantis has become synonymous with its outstanding range and versatility. Not only does the wing perform amazingly in waves, on ocean downwinders, but it&#8217;s also proved itself to excel on the racecourse or on the lakes and flat water venues. The Mantis Apex series takes the performance to a whole new level through the introduction of the Ultra HP frame material. Aside from a 22% weight saving in frame material, the big benefit comes from the ability to hold higher pressures, allowing us to reduce the LE diameter while maintaining stiffness. This leads to a leaner profile and a higher performing product. &#160; DESIGN PROFILE Visibility High pressure leading Edge Inflatable Dihedral with a medium aspect ratio outline Efficient profile and ultra lightweight design &#160; FEATURES Medium Dihedral Refined wingtip twist for increased sheeting range Lean LE profile Controllable power in a wide range of wind conditions High pressure reflex frame - Ultra-HP - inflated structure High rigidity single strut for low weight and predictable depower 2x Sprint inflate Valve for maximum airflow EVA Hi-Aero, light weight battens for increased leech stability Hi-vis, Weather resistant, low elongation TPU window Widespan anti-twist handles Load path panel layout MEDIUM DIHEDRIAL The Mantis Apex utilizes a medium Dihedral design to deliver a precisely balanced power to stability ratio. This translates to precision handling and feedback from the wing. TIP TWIST Refined wingtip twist allows for wing to breathe while maintaining canopy tension. LEAN LE Thanks to Ultra-HP the Mantis Apex has a lean profile for efficient upwind performance, wide speed range and an extremely responsive frame. STIFF STRUT A highly rigid single strut for low weight and predictable depower. 20/20 VISION A refined window layout, made from weather resistant TPU provides increased visibility when riding. POWER CONTROL Through a combination of Ultra-HP material, refined profiles and Tip Twist, the Mantis Apex has incredible controllable and power in a wide range of wind conditions.</description>

<title>2023 Duotone Entity Ergo</title>

<g:price>184.8000</g:price>
<description>
2023 Duotone Entity Ergo Straps Sizes: S / M / L / XL The revolutionary Entity Ergo is setting the new benchmark in hold, ergonomy, safety and comfort. Details The skeleton of a foot consists of 28 bones. The foot bones can be divided into following groups: tarsal bones, metatarsal bones and phalanxes. 20 muscles and over 114 tendons and ligaments ensure the required flexibility and stability of the bones to each other. A fine nerve and blood vessel network supplies the surface and deeper muscles above and below the foot. Long story short, that&#8217;s exactly why you need the new ergonomic NTT and the choice of four different sizes to find exactly the NTT which fits to your feet. The new strap design keeps your feet at the right place and the new fibre glass reinforced double hook closure system keeps the whole strap closed in any conditions. The economic EVA pad in combination with the toe padding is the guarantee to always have the right grip, an optimal pressure distribution with maximum comfort. This new ergonomic NTT gives relief to overstressed nerves and prevents fatigue and pain, your feet will get less tired and you&#8217;ll stay on the water longer. The ergonomic NTT footpads in combination with the adjustable heel pads help to reduce pressure on the heel and even avoid shocks on the entire body, helping alleviate long-term foot, back and knee pain. An additional nice little gimmick is the possibility to stick the screws of the pad on the bottom of the pad, so you don&#8217;t lose them whilst travelling! Slide into your new slippers! Size Chart SIZES S M L XL EU 36 - 39 39 - 43 43 - 45 45 - 47 US 4 - 6.5 6.5 - 10 10 - 11 11 - 13 UK 3.5 - 5.5 5.5 - 9 9 - 10 10 - 12 SIZE - CHECK 190 - 215 MM 205 - 225 MM 215 - 235 MM 225 - 250 MM ENTITY SIZE CHECK The new Entity Ergo is a tailor made binding system with a perfect fit to your foot. During a long developing process we realized, the most accurate way to measure feet for a Kiteboarding binding, is to measure the sole of your foot without toes. To find the best fitting size of your Entity Ergo, please measure from the top of the midfoot, between the 2nd and 3rd toe, till the end of the heel. As the perfect fit is very important for your kiteboarding experience, please follow this measurement advice and also check the graphic. &#160;</description>

<title>2024 Duotone Unit</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=10102</link>
<g:price>1059.0000</g:price>
<description>
Description The 2024&#160;Unit&#160;is yet taken another step ahead of the pack and is spiced with a new level of riding comfort, improved drift stability and features you simply don&#8217;t want to miss. The Duotone Unit led the way in Wing design over the past years. Many of our competitors tried to copy and match the performance and handling, yet with the combination of wing design, technology and materials the Unit is still the benchmark out there. The 2024 model brings us another step forward with the introduction of a long carbon front handle allowing one-handed riding, an angled strut, which increases the riding comfort and with tweaks on the outline, twist and canopy tension further improving the Units power delivery and&#160;drift stability. Designer Ken Winner&#160;optimized the&#160;angles of the strut in the handle area, resulting in a more natural riding position with the back arm being straighter and not constantly pulled in, which is especially noticeable when riding toe side. The second great improvement to the handling is the introduction of a significantly longer carbon front handle, allowing the rider to bring the front hand further back and fly the wing one-handed for minutes. A benefit which opens doors to new tricks and a level of riding comfort you don&#8217;t want to miss. With further refinements to the outline and curvature as well as the twist and tension of the MOD3 canopy, the new Unit flies more precise and stable when sheeted in and has a more neutral drift when flagged out on the wave. Whether you&#8217;re into pure and effortless carves in the surf, want to boost big airs with solid hang time or simply want to go&#160;straight forward&#160;with plenty of lift and power - the 2024 Unit is a real Winner &#8211;&#160;not only by the Designers Name &#8211; equally by the outstanding performance and its handling!</description>

Inspired by the shape of the ROCKET SURF, it wanted to create the next best board that would be even more maneuverable and reactive while surfing, as well as in freeride and pumping with a wing. Enter the ROCKET WING-S range. Although of the same compact lengths as their ROCKET WING counterpart, these boards are narrower and with a little less volume. They feature a deep concave cockpit-like deck that lowers your center of gravity and brings you closer to the foil, leading to excellent control of the board in-flight. Take-offs have never been so smooth thanks to the double concave hull and the beveled rail profile extending to the tail, which facilitates pumping to be up and flying in no time. The slightly domed nose also brings more volume for easy starts. The surf-type nose shape will help you get back up quickly if the board dives in. The compact shape and outline of the board increase its overall maneuverability and performances. Finally, the Full Bamboo construction and Double Bamboo deck create a highly resistant and light shell all-around. The ROCKET WING-S are perfect for intermediate and experienced riders who want to enjoy surf-like feelings in wing foiling and who seek to continuously push themselves on the water. The boards are available in seven different sizes to suit everybody&#8217;s skill levels, goals, and builds. The&#160;3&#8217;6&#160;and&#160;3&#8217;10&#160;are geared towards the young Next Generation of wing foilers, while the&#160;5&#8217;0&#160;will be an ideal match for skillful riders of a bigger stature. We offer numerous sizes to then provide you with an ample choice of volumes: 20L, 24L, 32L, 36L, 42L, 48L and 54L. All boards are equipped with a full pad, inserts for three footstraps, and the Twin-Tracks system for foil compatibility. &#160; SIZE RANGE Size Dimensions Vol. Weight Strap Inserts* 3&#8217;6 112,5 x 44,5 x 5,6 cm 3&#8217;6 x 17.5&#8243; x 2.2&#8243; 20 L 3.5 Yes 3&#8217;10 118,5 x 47 x 6,1 cm 3&#8217;10 x 18.5&#8243; x 2.4&#8243; 24 L 3.7 Yes 4&#8217;4 132 x 49,5 x 8,8 cm 4&#8217;4 x 19.5&#8243; x 3.4&#8243; 32 L 4.0 Yes 4&#8217;6 137 x 51 x 9,1 cm 4&#8217;6 x 20&#8243; x 3.6&#8243; 36 L 4.2 Yes 4&#8217;8 142 x 53,5 x 9,9 cm 4&#8217;8 x 21&#8243; x 3.9&#8243; 42 L 4.5 Yes 4&#8217;10 147 x 54,5 x 10,3 cm 4&#8217;10 x 21.5&#8243; x 4.1&#8243; 48 L 4.8 Yes 5&#8217;0 152 x 57 x 10,8 cm 5&#8217;0 x 22.5&#8243; x 4.3&#8243; 54 L 5.1 Yes *Straps sold separately &#160;</description>

<g:price>1999.0000</g:price>
<description>
Description The Sky Style ticks all the boxes for any ambitious winger with the desire for more than just cruising! The Sky Style is widely known amongst ambitious wingers willing to take it further. Our R&amp;D team has refined the previous Sky Style and we&#8217;re offering the two larger shapes of 4&#8217;11&#8221; and 5&#8217;1&#8221; in our Vacuum Sandwich technology level. With a higher rocker in comparison to the Sky Free, the reactions of the Sky Style models are highly responsive and intuitive through increased leverage over the pitch of your foil, making them super balanced and fun to ride from lakes to open ocean surf. The higher nose adds extra room to load up for jumps and with its added volume, it recovers easily - also when landing jumps nose first. The recessed deck of the Sky Style makes starts and sinking the board incredibly balanced even when used in volume below the riders&#8217; body weight. The new rail bevels on the Sky Style shapes add higher clearance during tight turns on the wave face and improve the ability to pump these boards out of the water with an easier release. More parallel bottom contours throughout the mid-section improve the glide to pick up speed for take-off and reduce drag after landings and touch-downs to pop back up instantly. Unleash your talent with the Sky Style!</description>

<title>2023 North Nova Wing</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=9934</link>
<g:price>657.3000</g:price>
<description>
DESCRIPTION From North The 2023 Nova has a structurally balanced freeride shape for enhanced aerodynamic performance. Engineered for stability in gusty winds, the new Nova has a progressive swept outline and refined profile section, making it easier to handle and more stable when riding. Your front and back arm pressure is even, not backhand-heavy. The wing creates lift so that you can glide through turns effortlessly without any tail drop. Precise yet compliant. The wingtip geometry and balanced dihedral also prevent oscillation side-to-side when gripping the front handle, riding downwind swell, surfing, or simply walking towards the water. With a sweet spot so generous, it makes hard things easy. The new draft-forward curvature in the profile section generates more lift in the front of the wing. This makes transitions smoother and, when combined with improved canopy tensioning, boosts Nova&#8217;s low-end power. So much so you can drop down a size. The stiffer, more responsive airframe and tighter skin tensioning mean the canopy stays clean through a wider wind range. We&#8217;ve minimized flutter and created a clean trailing edge release with reduced drag. To ensure the wing remains stable and comfortable in overpowered conditions, we&#39;ve tapered the leading-edge diameter, concentrating the stiffness in the LE center and allowing the reflexed wingtips to dump excess power. Master of the upwind, glide through tacks, float through gybes, and lofty jumps with bonus hangtime. Whatever goal you&#8217;re chasing, the Nova will send you there faster. Your everything. A wing with power when needed, leaving no rider wanting. Maximum low-end to get you up on the foil earlier. Top-end performance that lets you exploit gusty conditions. A wing that feels stable and balanced to fly, has lift through maneuvers and feels light in your hands.

Thanks to its optimized design and Sail Engineering, the STRIKE is a masterpiece of aerodynamism. This fourth version of our iconic wing has been refined to guarantee new sensations, and hence unforgettable, high-performance sessions. Optimized design for unprecedented performance HITEX and TECHNOFORCE materials for increased durability Perfect control of the profile and deformations to guarantee comfort throughout the entire wind range Unmatched speed and power delivery &#8220;Going Forward&#8221; feeling Impressive pop, hangtime, and upwind performances Intuitive pumping for easy planing starts Equipped with our new interchangeable handle system F-one&#8217;s new STRIKE features once more a super intuitive pumping with a certain flexibility that makes it easy to start planing without having to expend a lot of energy or learn a special technique. This STRIKE responds to pumping with immediate power. They&#8217;ve worked on the wing&#8217;s balance and aerodynamics to ensure exceptional and superior performance, while maintaining control and precision. This new STRIKE offers an unrivalled smoothness of traction that makes it possible to ride effortlessly, as if using a smaller, very light wing. The STRIKE&#8217;s control throughout the wind range is impressive, allowing you to easily handle gusts. For those who love speed, the wing provides a new &#8220;Going Forward&#8221; feeling that unlocks thanks to an impressive forward traction delivering fantastic horizontal acceleration. In the low end, it never seems to suffer from air holes or heading winds, maintaining a constant glide and exceptional upwind abilities. Thanks to its stiffness, accelerations, and massive pop and hangtime, the STRIKE will also have you hooked on freestyle. For your rotations, the wing turns easily on its own, allowing you to land all your tricks and try out new ones. This STRIKE is much more than a new model; it&#8217;s a perfect blend of performance, a lightweight feel and smooth traction. Design The design of the STRIKE has been entirely revised. The central strut is now completely straight, which allows us to better control its deformation and possible twisting, while reducing drag. As a result, the infill is a bit lower and deforms less, and we&#8217;ve extended it almost all the way to the back. F-One&#8217;s innovative Load Diffuser is reduced for weight gain, especially during freefly. F-One also added dihedral angle to improve stability and keep the wingtips out of the water when pumping and riding. The new leading and trailing edge tensions as well as a refined radial cut help keep the profile smooth and stable for incredible performance and control. The accurate panel layout, precise load management and staggered seams continue to bring exceptional control of the profile, especially in the high end. The use of HITEX on the inflatable structure and TECHNOFORCETM/D2 on the canopy offer great resistance to elongation and therefore greater durability and performances. The materials are also perfectly distributed to account for the different tensions, high pressures, and weight distribution in each specific area. Small radial cuts are implemented on the wingtips and on the back of the strut to spread tensions. Aligning the fibre exactly along the load paths means that stretch can be controlled to a never-before-seen level on a wing. Located on the back of the strut, the Load Diffuser made of overlapping panels of hard Mylar and Dacron further helps maintaining the profile sleek and efficient, leading to the ultimate stability, performances, and longevity. Thanks to this Sail Engineering and design work, the new STRIKE is an ideal compromise of performance, control, and smoothness. The wing feels stiff enough for any rider to perform and stay in control, but remains at the same time very progressive, offering a gentle and swift forward traction. Handles: The new STRIKE is fitted with our new interchangeable handle system. Soft, hybrid or rigid handles, you now get to customize handles at your preference.</description>

RIDE The Go Foil RIDE is designed for the perfect balanced ride with a Go Foil foil set up. The volume is forward on the boards providing flotation so you can ride a shorter board, but still is easy to stand on. The flotation up front allows the board to stay on top of the water when you touch down. The decks are flat, easy to transition on and off the board as well as easy to move around on the board while foiling. The bottom is flat for easy and quick release to get up on foil. Soft rails help with getting on and off the board and keeps the boards from sticking when touching down. The tail has a little kick behind the boxes for quick release. CONSTRUCTION EPS core with full sandwich construction, built for strength. Innegra wraps the deck for added protection against dings. Airvent-provides no maintenance. Handle on the bottom for ease of carrying. Built with tuttle and plate options. Large deck pad, easy to stand on.

Description The original feeling returns with the ORIGIN, F ONE&#8217;s new wing. As its name indicates, the ORIGIN is a wing that recalls the easy, comfortable feel of our original wings, with which many discovered and first tasted the thrill of wing foiling. An accessible , light , and forgiving wing Legendary pumping and easy take offs Optimized design for extra lightness and comfort Impressive freefly abilities in light wind Equipped with our new interchangeable handle system We have developed the ORIGIN for anyone who wants to discover wing foiling today with all our know how and current experience, as well as for all those nostalgic for our first wings. The ORIGIN benefits from the extensive Sail Engineering work done over the years, including new designs and the most modern technologies and materials. An absolute dream in the low end, the ORIGIN is a super comfortable, light, forgiving, and accessible all round wing that feels effortless to ride. It allows the easiest take offs with minimal pumping and with just enough speed to get going. Beginners and experts alike will appreciate its very efficient and intuitive pumping thanks to its flexibility, as well as its super smooth take offs. This wing is the softest and most comfortable one of our range. The ORIGIN also offers intuitive power delivery with barely any adjustments needed once in the air. Simply sheet in and let it make you foil away. Its controlled speed allows you to ride without excessive effort or fatigue. The ORIGIN is for everyone. It is the ideal choice for riders looking to spend long hours on the water, those who ride larger foils and boards and need easy power for planing starts, or for beginners looking for a high quality wing with great potential to evolve and progress. Its lightness truly sets it apart from our other wings, making it also perfect to freefly in the low end. The ORIGIN is a great addition to your quiver as a light wind wing. &#160; Design Although inspired by the STRIKE and the SWING, the ORIGIN&#8217;s design has been optimized to guarantee as much lightness and comfort as possible. With our staggered seams, the fabric and its seams work better to keep a smooth and efficient profile and to reduce the deformation of the wing&#8217;s shape under load. The control of the profile is ideal to guarantee total stability and comfort during the ride. Small radial cuts are implemented on the wingtips and on the back of the strut to spread tensions. Aligning the fiber exactly along the load paths means that stretch can be controlled to a never before seen level on a wing. Located on the back of the strut, our refined Load Diffuser made of overlapping panels of hard Mylar and Dacron further helps maintaining the profile sleek and efficient, leading to the ultimate stability, performances, and longevity. The strut and the two central segments of the leading edge on each side of the strut are made of HITEX 158g. This high tenacity polyester offers great resistance to elongation and therefore greater durability and performance. The remaining segments of the leading edge are made of Dacron 150g to guarantee lightness and comfort.&#160; The ORIGIN&#8217;s canopy is in TECHNOFORCE&#8482;/D2 in 52g, while the thicker TECHNOFORCE&#8482;/D2 in 66g is on the trailing edge, just like the STRIKE. These materials are perfectly distributed to account for the different tensions, high pressures, and weight distribution of each area.&#160; Like the latest editions of our editions of our other other wings, the central strut is completely straight, which allows us to better control its deformation and possible twisting, while reducing drag. As a result, the infill is a bit lower and deforms less, and we&#39;ve extended it almost all the way to the back. Handles The ORIGIN is fitted with our new interchangeable handle system: soft, hybrid or fully rigid, the choice is yours. Wings come with soft handles pre installed, but it is now possible for riders to customize handles at their preference.</description>

MAST / FUSELAGE We prioritize performance over convenience, so we chose to mold the mast and fuselage in one piece. The advantages of one-piece construction are increased stiffness, superior strength, no weak points of connections and extreme reduction of reliance of metal parts. Built with 100% pre-preg carbon fiber. Pre-preg is when carbon fiber is directly impregnated with epoxy resin, resulting in a perfect ratio for the highest quality process. ASSEMBLY We believe in simple and strong. All hardware is provided with each mast.

<g:price>799.0000</g:price>
<description>
Description If you are looking for a lightweight, dynamic and powerful kite for the ultimate in freeride and foil performance, the new 2022 Mono is the kite you need. With a super-low aspect design, the kite delivers plenty of low-end power and is optimised for light wind conditions. The wind range is wide, and you&#8217;ll enjoy longer sessions on the water if the wind picks up. Lots of one strut kites suffer from flutter when the wind increases, and as such, they have a very narrow wind range. The Mono uses the best materials available with a unique canopy profile and wide chord depth to keep flutter to an absolute minimum. The reduced weight of the kite makes for exciting performance in the air. In light winds, the drift and hang of the kite is incredible, and the low aspect nature makes it almost impossible to back stall. This makes it a really easy to use kite for newcomers to the sport. There is still plenty of performance to unlock, though with impressive handling and fast bar response. The Mono is a fantastic kite for foilers who want simplicity, the free-rider looking for a light wind weapon, and even wave riders who have light winds at their spot. If you travel a lot and want to keep weight to a minimum, then this is the perfect kite for you. The easy to fly and forgiving nature of the Mono makes it perfect for a wide range of abilities; from beginner to expert, the kite has something to offer everyone. With instant relaunch, you&#8217;ll spend more time kiting and less time in the water too. Over the years, the Mono has seen a lot of development; for 2022; it&#8217;s on another level again. Simply the best one strut kite on the market, accept no substitute, ride the Mono!</description>

Description Dial the kite into the way you want to ride for the day, set it for unhooked with maximum power delay, or for loops with maximum power. The Vegas has a trophy cabinet that&#39;s buckling under the weight of the silverware. The choice of champions such as Mikaili Sol and Gianmaria Coccoluto, and progressive legends like Aaron Hadlow. Designed to perform at the very highest level for the most demanding riders looking for the ultimate in freestyle performance. The key to the kite&#39;s continued success is the power delay the kite delivers after take-off. As well as providing explosive pop, the kite lines go slack after you release the edge. This allows you to perform the latest tricks with ease and the only thing holding you back is your imagination. There is no better-performing kite on the market for unhooked riding; with the loaded 5th line and pure C kite shape, this is a thoroughbred waiting to be tamed. Sometimes the wind is strong, and freestyle fades with thoughts of big air and powerful loops; the Vegas has this in its DNA and gives you an exciting ride with plenty of control and power in abundance. Pull the trigger, send the kite, hang on, or park the kite, load, edge, and pop; the choice is yours; defy gravity however you choose to ride the Vegas!</description>

<g:price>2249.9900</g:price>

IN STOCK NOW!!! &#160; Armstrong Downwind Boards The evolution of the Downwind board concept. Overview :&#160; Taking what we learned from the Downwind boards initially introduced in 2023, the evolution of these boards is faster, more refined and even more stable per size for riders from rookie through advanced. Like the previous generation, these boards are also terrifically versatile and are excellent for lightwind winging and SUP surf foiling. Seeking greater efficiency and user friendliness in the paddle popup, each size has been lengthened by 3.5-5% to improve paddling speed and increase stability. The foil tracks are now further forward as well for increased manoeuvrability and lift. When combined with subtle refinements to the rocker line and overall shape of the tail, these boards lift off the water exceptionally cleanly and easily. Inspired by the new deck grip design on our Wing FG foilboards, the Downwind and Downwind Performance boards include a fully redesigned grip tailored specifically to provide riders with maximum control, comfort and versatility when downwinding. In conjunction with the flatter deck shape, this grip features raised central bars above the foil tracks and elevated blocks in each corner of the pad, front and back, for intuitive foot placement. Boards come with deck grips uninstalled so that riders can finish building their perfect setup. Features :&#160; - Increased length - Greater paddling speed with improved stability and tracking for easier paddling. - Split foredeck - Inspired by our Wing FG boards, the split anhedral foredeck shape sheds water with ease. - Refined bow - Improved paddling efficiency and touchdown recovery and reduced swing weight for pumping and carving. - Minimal deck recess - A flatter deck to hold more volume and shed standing water more quickly. - New deck grip - Like on our Wing FG board range, raised deck grip arch bars and front/rear corner blocks provide intuitive foot placement references. - Diamond V tail - All new tail shape with significantly more rocker and an extra chine to improve takeoff performance and minimise tail touchdowns when pumping and carving. - Foil track placement - Pushed further forward for increased lift and manoeuvrability. - Carbon foil tracks - Proprietary carbon fibre foil tracks are keyed directly into the fibres of the stringers for a fully integrated construction. - Proven Construction - Deck to bottom i-beam dual stringers provide maximum structural rigidity and durability. &#160; Specs : 96L: 7&#8217;2 / 218cm x 19 1/2&quot; / 49.5cm x 5 1/2&#8221; 14cm 106L: 7&#8217;5 / 226cm x 20&#8221; / 50.8cm x 5 3/4&#8221; / 14.6cm 116L: 7&#8217;9 / 236cm x 20 1/4&quot; / 51.4cm x 5 3/4&#8221; / 14.6cm 128L: 8&#8217;1 / 246cm x 20 3/4&quot; / 52.7cm x 6&#8221; / 15.2cm 140L: 8&#8217;5 / 256cm x 21 3/4&quot; / 53.6cm x 6&#8221; / 15.2cm</description>

OUR NEW AND INNOVATIVE &#8220;FORWARD GEOMETRY&#8221; WING SURF BOARD DESIGNS, HIGHLIGHT THE DRIVE AND PASSION WE HAVE TO ALWAYS BE IMPROVING AND MAXIMIZING THE POTENTIAL OF EVERY RIDE! The logic behind Forward Geometry is all about the mast track position in relation to the center of the board. The further forward the mast can go the better, it improves maneuverability, response and dramatically reduces the rotational swing weight effect. Combine this with state-of-the-art 320mm Carbon fiber A+System Mast Tracks and you have maximum potential to get your board and foils geometry working for you! Without question, shorter boards offer superior maneuverability, feel and control once on the fly but getting them there is not so easy. Until now that is, as boards get shorter it becomes important to maximise stability and hull speed when still attached to the water. The new Forward Geometry shapes from Armstrong have addressed this issue with a beautiful innovative approach enabling everyone to take advantage of the benefits riding shorter boards. The new Forward Geometry range of boards are packed full of innovation. Forward Geometry&#8230; Our new A+System Mast Tracks are positioned well forward in the board to reduce rotational swing weight which radically improves handling and response. High strength custom Carbon fiber A+System Mast Tracks&#8230; Plastic simply does not do the job well enough, so we designed our own 320mm Carbon Fiber mast tracks. Recessed deck&#8230; This brings you closer to the mast top for direct handling and feel. Through deck carry handle/water evacuation&#8230; Easy to carry top or bottom, the through board handle is also the water evacuation for the recessed deck. Extended waterline profile view&#8230; Speed is the key, so we use all the boards waterline to help accelerate the board forward. Chisel-nose outline&#8230; Offers stability on the water and helps push the water under the board rather than splitting it around the board. Aggressive nose rocker into an accentuated double concave to flat&#8230; This is all about bringing the nose up quickly to accelerate the water down the double concave to flat bottom at the tail. Innovative tail shape&#8230; For better acceleration, less drag at the rear waterline release area, it looks faster because it is! Accentuated chines&#8230; As the board picks up speed and the foil starts to lift, the contact area reduces, making for a smooth transition from on the water to foiling and also seamless touchdowns as the board does not grab as it touches the water&#8217;s surface. Stable Volume distribution&#8230; The recessed deck, wide Chisel nose and relatively rectangular outline means we can push the volume to the extremities, makes for a stable platform when on the water. Light and strong&#8230; Lightweight is nothing without strength so we have chosen the best materials to keep the boards both light and strong. Foam core with multiple PVC reinforcements, Dual Carbon stringers, covered with Carbon fiber and Dyneema cloth.

DESCRIPTION [Arrow icon] A couple years ago, our close friend Ydwer had a heavy surf accident that changed his life completely, no longer being able to move his hands or legs. Ydwer van der Heide is one of the most celebrated photographers in the industry who&#160;we&#39;ve had the pleasure of working with for many years. As a tribute to him and his work, we&#39;ve created the Ydwer harness, which features his own photography and comes with all the usual features of the Majestic.</description>

<g:price>80.0000</g:price>
<description>
DESCRIPTION [Arrow icon] The ShiftLock Carbon handles provide an instant reaction to your input, with the bonus of being able to slide and lock into infinite positions. Carbon ShiftLock handles are purchased separately from the wing, which makes it easy to find your perfect setup. There&#160;are four carbon handle lengths, from the single 1100 boom to the 500, 400, and 250 mm handles. Follow the size chart to determine the best handle combination for your wing size. If you&#39;re a more experienced rider and you know what you want, then you&#39;ve got the option to either downsize or go for a boom. The 1100 boom is our lightest handle option. Although it&#39;s the longest handle, it only has two connection points, so the overall weight is lower than two separate bars with 4 mounts. This suits a rider wanting a lighter rig for lighter winds and larger wings. The boom is also the most cost-effective option and would suit any rider&#8217;s ability; it&#8217;s more forgiving because it allows you to slide your hand up and down during tacks. The smaller 250 handles target the more advanced rider looking for targeted positioning. The ShiftLock 1100M Boom does not fit on the Nova Pro 2.9M</description>

The Nova Freeride is a balanced, easy-to-use all-round wing with a wide wind range, low end power, high-end stability, and light, intuitive handling. For 2024 we&#39;ve introduced Carbon UDi Technology into the wingtips, stiffening the airframe and enabling it to snap back into shape faster after tricks and maneuvers. We&#39;ve also changed the draft position and depth, making the wing even more balanced and user-friendly. The new radial load diffuser ensures more even tensioning and a tighter canopy for enhanced performance. Master of the upwind, glide through tacks, float through gybes, and lofty jumps with bonus hangtime. Whatever goal you&#8217;re chasing, the Nova will send you there faster. Features: Suits new riders to seasoned pros Stable geometry with nose-positive lift Compact outline for upwind efficiency New Radial Load Diffuser for even tensioning Balanced trailering for riding swell Maximum low-end power for instant up &amp; go New effective wide-angle windows Intuitive rigid GripLock handles Independent double chamber HyperFlow Lightweight bladders Versatile and easy to use Excellent loft and hangtime Materials: New Carbon UDi Technology New N-X6 TE Panels N-HTRS High Performance Canopy Material Durable and Lightweight Dacron Airframe Lightweight bladders</description>

DESCRIPTION [Arrow icon] The Sonar Foil System is connected to the board by a lightweight CNC-machined aluminium Board Adaptor with a tapered geometry locking connection that engages with the mast, fusing Board Adaptor and mast together to build one union for optimum load transfer and a&#160;stronger, more direct feeling and steering impulse when foiling.

Incorporates a strong geometry locking connection for better energy transfer and a more direct feel.</description>

It also allows you to get bigger air and longer hang time with less effort and input from yourself.

<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=10126</link>
<g:price>524.3000</g:price>
<description>
Description All-new for 2023, the design team have reworked one of the most popular freeride boards on the planet to make it even better! Perfect for riders looking to cruise and boost, the Select offers plenty of comfort on the water - with a turn of pace and performance that will excite you. The outline has been made narrower and longer this year; this improves the handling when carving from rail to rail and allows you to hold an edge with ease, and the upwind capabilities are even better. Space Flex ensures the flex is finely tuned to give you a smooth ride and offer excellent pop. The bigger Space Flex window in the tips also adds even more damping, making the board feel like it has suspension without sacrificing performance. The Select is also excellent in light winds and quick to get on plane, offering you plenty of power and performance when you need it. The new shape means you need to choose a slightly longer board to get the improved performance. For example, if you rode a 138/41 last year, you&#8217;d prefer a 141/40 this year. If you want a freeride board that will get you riding earlier, make your sessions smoother and give you bigger jumps, the Select is it!</description>

<g:price>1757.0000</g:price>
<description>
Description: NEW FOR 2024, THE NEO RAISES THE BAR ONCE AGAIN FOR WAVE-RIDING PERFORMANCE; WITH UPDATED WING TIPS AND A NEW PROFILE SHAPE, THE KITE OFFERS IMPROVED WIND RANGE AND EVEN MORE DYNAMIC HANDLING. The Neo has been at the forefront of wave riding since the very beginning; new for 2024, the Neo epitomises our versatile, solid, performance philosophy. The new kite features an improved wingtip shape and construction. This further enhances the turning characteristics of the kite and improves its handling, making it even more dynamic. The new construction uses more Trinity TX in the wingtip area of the kite, reducing the weight and helping it to drift down the line without sacrificing durability. The overall profile of the kite has been updated, too; it now features a slightly deeper centre profile with a moderately deeper profile towards the tips. These changes help to increase the kite&#39;s low-end power and load the wingtips for more precise handling, making the steering incredibly responsive. These improvements make the Neo fantastic for riding waves; with lightning speed in the turn and incredible drift, it is easy to see why it has become one of the most popular wave kites on the market. Versatility is key here, equipped with multiple settings on the tips that allow you to fine-tune the kite&#39;s performance according to the day&#39;s conditions. So, whether you&#39;re enjoying a flatwater strapless freestyle session or riding the waves, the Neo can be adjusted for maximum pop and powerful loops or optimised for exceptional drift and rapid turning speed. Another excellent feature of the Neo lies in its remarkable power delivery across the entire wind range. With abundant low-end power, this kite enables you to ride with a smaller, more dynamic size, enhancing your overall performance. At the same time, the Neo offers an extensive upper range with generous depower, allowing you to stay on the water for longer when the conditions change. With plenty of updates and upgrades for 2024, the new Neo will be hard to beat, this class-leading wave kite pushes the boundaries once more, and all you have to do is be along for the ride. Features: DOUBLE-V PIGTAILS These pigtails distribute the load of the line connections to the kite, minimizing the risk of fatigue, making the kite less prone to distortion and helps it to steer more smoothly. KOOK PROOF CONNECTORS The kook proof line connection points prevent accidents by guaranteeing that you cannot accidentally connect your lines incorrectly when rigging your kite. LOAD DISTRIBUTION PANELS As kite geometry improves, the canopy must continue to resist increasing forces. To spread these forces, Load-Distribution-Panels are used, holding the kite&#8217;s shape even under the most extreme loads. In practice this gives a smoother and more consistent performance from the kite in any riding situation. MODERN TRAILING EDGE DESIGN A narrower trailing edge and a lighter combination of materials to reduce wear and to create a slicker kite profile. FUSION STRUT This construction allows for a controlled distribution of forces between strut and leading edge. Struts are 100% connected to the leading edge with a flexible Dyneema line,which promotes higher canopy tension and a clean profile. ANTI SNAG The Anti Snag webbing is preventing the lines from tangling around the tip of the kite. Waterstarts are made easier and safety is increased. TRINITY TX Teijin is the world&#8217;s leading supplier of polyester fabrics and sail materials to marine sports. The combined creative power of Duotone Kiteboarding saw the formulation of TRINITY TX. Exclusive to Duotone Kiteboarding, TRINITY TX is a 3x2 canopy material, which has proven to be far superior to other canopy ma&#8230; HEAVY DUTY LEADING EDGE CLOSING SEAM The leading edges of all kites are extremely durable due to a special heavy duty closing seam. The Dacron material at the leading edge is reinforced with a self sticky Insignia Tape and double stitched additionally. The Heavy Duty Leading Edge Closing Seam is resistant to very high tensions and diagonal forces.</description>

BALANCED / RIGID / PULL &#160; WHY YOU&#39;LL LOVE IT When the sport you love is powered by the wind, choosing the best way to harness its energy is critical. We can all agree, flying, turning and gliding certainly sounds better than slogging and bogging.

Adjustable bar length New Depower sheath to increase durability New automatic lifeline swivel Intuitive and super precise depower system Superior functionality The bar itself is small in diameter with a comfortable grip making it forgiving on the hands. The grip has a rubbery feel with a fine texture and feels firm underneath and a bit more cushy on the top where your fingers wrap around the bar. The integrated floats at the bar ends house the mechanism to adjust the size of your bar. Simply pull down the tag under the bar, rotate the insert and your bar size is changed. You will also find the possibility to adjust your back lines length. It features a lifeline now placed into a new rectangular depower sheath for more durability.

DC;&#160;The Duel Carbon stringer system offers a sublime feel when riding and leading stiffness and durability. &#160; Forward Geometry Limitless options to fasttrack your progression. Emphasising modularity within board design, Armstrong introduced a major innovation to the wing board space in 2021 with the Forward Geometry concept. Designed to work with any brand of foil, the FG design increases responsiveness by placing the foil more centrally and reducing swing weight in turns. The Wing board range carries on that design legacy with FG foil tracks that are strategically placed well forward for maximum manoeuvrability and a hyper connected feel on foil, delivering high performance to riders on all the board sizes. &#160; The tracks are positioned in the ideal location to suit all skill levels. Riders can grow into their setup at their own pace by progressing mast position from the rear to the front of the tracks as desired.

2023 F-One Strike V3 CWC Wing Sizes: 6m / 7m / 8m Description: Light, compact, and easy to use, the STRIKE CWC V3 is the quintessential light-wind weapon. Our patented 3-strut wing has proven to be the ideal concept for a successful large surface wing, and the STRIKE CWC has dominated light-wind wing foiling since its appearance on the market. Featuring a new and revolutionary design as well as F-ONE&#8217;s latest technologies and materials, this CWC V3 will let you show off your wing foiling skills in full confidence on any light wind day. Patented compact design provides maximum power with impressive maneuverability. Smaller wingspan brings efficient pumping and maintains the wingtips away from the surface of the water. A small diameter center strut allows these large surfaces to keep a record weight. Its perfect balance facilitates the creation of apparent wind, while increasing its high end&#160;capacities. New HITEX and NANO for increased durability. For this CWC V3, we have worked on three areas: the materials, the placement of these materials and the design to improve performance and durability. MATERIALS: The airframe of the STRIKE CWC V3 is made of HITEX 158g and 178g. This brand-new high tenacity polyester exclusive to F-ONE offers great resistance to elongation and therefore greater durability and performances. The central strut is thinner in diameter thanks to the HITEX 158g and its independent valve that allows for a better control of its pressure. Its longitudinal reinforcements help command its shape and resistance. The two central segments of the leading edge on each side of the strut are made of HITEX 178g, while the remaining segments are in 158g. Both materials are perfectly distributed to account for the different tensions, high pressures, and weight distribution in this area. Since the beginning, we have also kept a thin leading edge diameter at the wingtips, bringing agility, comfort and glide, but also lightness and less inertia. Finally, the CWC V3 features our new NANO canopy. This innovative micro ripstop polyester in 55g is used on the entire canopy of the wing. It benefits from a NANO coating and a Plasma treatment process that brings an increased rigidity, resistance to elongation and tears, and durability. With optimized materials and design, this wing remains light and comfortable. Features: WING DESIGN: Through Sail Engineering, we have conceived a completely new design; everything has been precisely thought-out to adapt the wing&#8217;s shape to the tensions and new materials. Every panel on the CWC V3 is precisely laid to carry a specific load. The front of the wing combines horizontal panels separated by a vertical seam from the innovative radial center panels, which are mapped to accurately follow every load trajectory. The trailing edge is controlled by a vertical panel. Small radial cuts are also implemented on the wingtips and on the back of the strut to spread tensions. Aligning the fibre exactly along the load paths means that stretch can be controlled to a never-before- seen level on a wing. Thanks to this precise load management, the wind range of the STRIKE CWC is extended and the range of wind strengths where the wing feels perfect is greater than ever before. With our staggered seams, the fabric and its seams work better to keep a smooth and efficient profile and the flying shape of the wing never deforms under load. The control of the profile is ideal and its stability is excellent, allowing everyone to ride fully balanced on both arms and in total comfort. The new trailing edge tensions and radial cuts have brought incredible performance and control. Located on the back of the strut, our innovative Load Diffuser made of overlapping panels of hard Mylar and Dacron further helps maintaining the profile sleek and efficient, leading to the ultimate stability, performances, and longevity. Every reinforcement on this wing has been reviewed to ensure durability and to save weight. HANDLES: To further improve and optimize the rider&#8217;s control of the wing, we have rigidified our handles while keeping our original, lighter construction that doesn&#8217;t include any hard parts that could damage your wing, ding your board, or hit yourself. Our grippy, ergonomic and comfortable handles allow for some flexibility so your wrist is always in line with your arm. This also gave us the opportunity to design the strut just as we liked. The front of it goes down straight away on your front hand before going up into the wing&#8217;s profile near your back hand. This leads to a more natural position to sheet in. THE LIGHT WIND REVOLUTION: Light wind riding has never been so effective. Our Compact Wing Concept (CWC) patent allows adding more surface into a given wingspan without compromising lightness and performances. The two extra struts increase the wing&#8217;s surface without increasing the leading edge&#8217;s length and diameter. This specific geometry brings great power with ease of use and therefore a light feel with less wingspan. The compact outline makes it easy to obtain an incredible start when planing and pumping. Highly maneuverable and easy to flip around when on the water, the CWC V3 lets you ride effortlessly, making you feel like you&#39;re using a 5m&#178;, and with wingtips naturally staying away from the surface of the water. Finally, the already impressive high range of this wing has been improved so you can absorb the gusts if the wind picks up. The STRIKE CWC V3 is available in four sizes, ranging from 6 to 9m&#178;. With this design perfectly adapted to bigger surfaces, we have added the 9m&#178; to the range this year. This size will allow riders of a bigger stature to make the most out of their light wind sessions. Strut your stuff with the STRIKE CWC V3, a complete game changer for your light wind days.</description>

<title>2021 S26 Naish Matador</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=8677</link>
<g:price>249.9900</g:price>
<description>
The Wing-Surfer Matador is compact, light and powerful. It is designed for experienced wing foilers that want to use the smallest wing possible for the prevailing wind conditions, with a focus on riding swells and waves. The Matador has a deeper draft and larger diameter leading edge and strut than a comparably sized Wing-Surfer, with the power placed even further forward. The leading-edge taper is more pointed at the center and carries more dihedral across the wingspan. This all comes together to create a wing that drives upwind with ease, then flags in neutral with amazing stability and balance for riding waves, swells and doing downwinders. With tons of sheet-in-and-go power, even heavier riders will find it easy to get up on their foil. Once flagged into neutral on a wave or swell, the light and nimble airframe all but disappears like a bull fighter&#8217;s cape &#8212; allowing you to carve and glide with ease. Thus, the name &#8220;Matador.&#8221; Unlike the all-around Wing-Surfer, the Matador is designed to be ridden mostly upwind then flagged downwind, so the windows are small and placed where an experienced rider needs them when riding windward, knowing that most of the time the wing will be flagged behind them with full visibility.</description>

The JAM has been designed for dock start and pump foil. With its substantial surface area and aspect ratio of 10, this foil brings infinite glide, incredible lift, early and easy take-offs, and an astounding level of efficiency. Exceptional for dock starts and pump foiling Aspect Ratio: 10 Infinite glide and outstanding efficiency Easy and fast take-offs Effective at low speeds and has the potential to accelerate on demand Description: With only just a few pumps, you&#8217;ll be out of the water and gliding along at speed in no time with the JAM. Even if you stop pumping for a few seconds, it keeps gliding. The distinct design, angle of attack and profile reduce the induced drag even further and bring even more efficiency and performance. The wingtips have been designed to provide a decent maneuverability so the JAM is not only a pumping machine, but also fun to cruise around on. Successfully combining early take-off abilities with good speed, the JAM delivers a smooth and precise ride. Its high aspect ratio and extreme efficiency at low speeds also make it ideal for wing foiling and downwinding in marginal conditions. The JAM can gain speed if necessary, allowing the rider to go faster, to use it in light wind winging conditions, and to even ride small waves with ease. Built using the Monobloc structure with pre-preg carbon, this foil is both very light and strong. This setup brings improved load transmission and better stiffness throughout the different parts for maximum control. The High Modulus Carbon fiber layup leads to even more rigidity and stability that will propel you to incredible performances in each session. The TITAN connection allows to plug in either an aluminum or carbon mast. The JAM is available in two sizes: 1600 cm&#178; and 1900 cm&#178;. The 1600 cm&#178; is ideal to wing foil or SUP foil in marginal conditions and light winds, or for riders who already know how to dock start. It is also the perfect foil to learn how to SUP downwind. The 1900 cm&#178; is great for dock-starts, pumping in flat waters, and for riders of a bigger stature. This foil is recommended with the Monobloc Tail Pumping XXS 200, which offers exceptional pumping abilities and a fantastic glide. The JAM caters to all levels of foilers, whether it&#8217;s beginners looking to get into pump foil, or more advanced riders wanting an efficient foil that will deliver in this discipline and minimal conditions. Grab your group of friends and enjoy a JAM session anytime, anywhere!</description>

Ozone Vortex Ultra-X Kiteboarding Kite This is the kite for anyone ready to take their twin-tip riding up a level!&#160;A King of the Air double-loop kite that also makes huge boosts and big air progression easy. The Vortex is a tightly tuned, lightweight, three strut design that&#8217;s been supercharged with an Aluula airframe.&#160; If your biggest love is to blast around on a twin-tip sending it big, whether you&#39;re already pulling kite loops, or are serious about learning them, the Vortex is for you. Lighter in steering and more whippy in its response and turning than the Edge, the Vortex accelerates around its tips, turning very consistently without any pause in flight. The Vortex will take anyone&#39;s twin tip riding to the next level. Aluula can provide a tensile strength increase of as much as 38% compared to standard material construction, while tear strength is up to seven times greater.&#160;Combining those advantages with the fact that careful integration of Aluula can also deliver up to a 30% weight saving, it&#8217;s the right air frame material for the high-performance goals set for the Vortex Ultra-X Features New school big air inspired 3-strut design with ultra stable Aluula airframe 16 point leading edge bridle connection for extreme stability Accessible and forgiving big air performance Fast handling and fast flying with super reliable catch after a kite loop Programmed for first kite loops to biggest doubles Lightweight design and easy bar pressure Double Transversal shaping for tight and efficient canopy High-strength and low drag Technora bridle lines Ride full power for max air time all day</description>

<g:price>1719.0000</g:price>
<description>
Ozone V1 Fusion Wing Foiling Wing Leave it to Ozone to go outside the box of what is the norm and create a Wing that is like no other Wing on the market today. The V1 Fusion wing designed around the high-performance platform of the Flux, including the pre-loaded leading edge, which is made with stiff performance Dacron. The V1 Fusion is a&#160;100% double surface ram air design creating an enclosed high-pressure space between the entire upper and lower surfaces. The internal rib structure supports both sail layers and helps the wing smoothly deal with dynamic pressure differentials when the wing&#8217;s angle-of-attack changes. REDUCING DRAG When the air travels over a wing it splits at the stagnation point on the leading edge. While the air that runs along the top surface has a clean and continuous surface to follow, the airflow on the bottom of a single surface wing creates vortices behind the leading edge. This turbulent underside flow creates drag which reduces performance. WHO IS IT FOR? The Fusion Wing is for those who are ready to experience a new realm of winging where previously unreachable performance is now achievable. It is suitable for experienced intermediate riders and beyond who are proficient at tacking and gybing, sending and landing airs confidently and who have reached a level where they don&#8217;t regularly have major, out of control wipeouts. Features Air Intake Valves&#160;-&#160;Inspired from wingsuits, they allow air to enter into the internals. They have been specifically designed to keep water out by using a valve system. Water Drainage Holes&#160;-&#160;In the rare event water does come inside the wing, there are four drainage holes on the trailing edge, two near the strut and two more on the tips. Streamlined Tip Junction&#160;-&#160;To maintain smooth aerodynamics where multiple sections are joined at the Fusion tips, the last upper and lower surface panels are split to connect to the highest and lowest point of the leading-edge tube. A closing panel is added to the split trailing edge in order to maintain even pressure inside the internals. Lower Surface Zipper&#160;-&#160;To minimize weight, the Fusion has only one zip on the lower surface that allows access to the inflate/deflate valves on the leading edge and strut. It also allows access in order to replace a bladder with no added difficulty compared to a single surface wing. Pre-Loaded Leading Edge&#160;-&#160;Using a performance Dacron material that is rigid and strong has allowed Ozone&#39;s designers to pre-load the leading edge and shape it to experience drastically less deformation under load.&#160;Combined with optimized sail shaping and horizontal panels for a tighter canopy, the Flux delivers huge aerodynamic performance gains. Rigid Power Handles&#160;-&#160;Ergonomically angled front and back carbon fiber handles with EVA grip provide maximum control and comfort with incredible feel and response. The front handle mount features a soft bumper to protect your head and board during water starts.</description>

Wing surfing is one of the most exhilarating ways of flying above the water. The freedom allowed by the handheld wing is amazing. Once you&#8217;ve learned how to use it, there are many reasons to opt for a dedicated Wing foilboard to best enjoy your Wing surf foiling.&#160; Our experience on wing foiling shows that after using our SUP Foil we could quickly switch to smaller boards. The surf foil boards on the other hand have proved to be quite extreme. Therefore we felt the need for a new type of shapes for wing surfing. We have created a new range of wing boards with a wide range of volumes to make it possible for most riders to stand-up easily as well making sure that riding back to the shore is possible, even when the wind drops. Their dimensions and shapes are unique and specific to the practice. Using the foil actively to create your motion is one of the biggest thrills of wing surf foiling. To ensure you can make the best use of your foil, we have created boards that will help you carve better on the swell, connect the bumps and enjoy your session.&#160; Compared to a larger board, the ROCKET WING has: Reduced bulk size and reduced weight Better balance, natural stance Improved maneuverability and responsiveness Pumping becomes more efficient and direct Easier transportation and travel All these advantages directly translate a lot more possibilities on the water.&#160; Using some straight rocker lines for an easy take-off and a wide tail outline for an optimized volume distribution, the ROCKET WING boards feature a sharp beveled rail profile to make the release easier during take-off and the touch-down smoother when the board hits the water again. In other words, you will be up and flying in no time and you won&#8217;t be unsettled when occasionally hitting the water.&#160; The ROCKET WING boards are equipped with a recessed handle for easy carrying, a full pad for comfort and with the twin track system on the bottom to connect with most foils on the market (4-bolt plate system). They are built with F-ONE&#8217;s proven bamboo construction with a double layer on deck for added resistance.&#160; If flying a Surf Wing is your new foiling style, the ROCKET WING boards are the perfect matching ride. How to choose your volume and board size for foiling with a Surf Wing? Beginner : Weight +40l (Rocket SUP) Intermediate : Weight +10l (Rocket Wing) Advanced : Weight -15l (Rocket Wing)</description>

The TRAX has a long heritage and is one of the most popular twin tips on the market. It is the ultimate freeride and freestyle board with a unique feeling on the water, offering both speed and comfort. The HRD Rail plays a significant role in the way the board performs, and it sets it apart from everything else out there. &#8226; Ultimate freeride/freestyle board &#8226; HRD Rail Technology &#8226; Easy to ride &#8211; perfect for beginners and experts alike &#8226; Smooth and forgiving HRD CONSTRUCTION HRD is a unique construction process that allows for the rails of the board to be shaped in 3D. There are three sections to the rail as it runs the length of the board. In the middle of the board, the rail is thin for grip and improved upwind ability, under the feet the rail is inverted and curved like a surfboard rail allowing the board to smoothly track through chop and improving its carving ability. As the rail reaches the tips, it thins out again allowing superior grip and bite to give excellent pop. LITE TECH The Lite Tech is an exclusive to F-ONE. Patented by Rossignol Snowboards it integrates a TPU element into the board allowing light to pass right through. It doesn&#8217;t offer any performance advantages, but it does look fantastic, and it will help you stand out from the crowd on the water. Available in two graphic versions (men/women), the Lite Tech also looks incredible in photographs, we can&#8217;t guarantee extra Instagram likes, but it&#8217;s bound to help! DESIGN The construction mixes unidirectional and bi-axial fibers at 45&#176; to achieve the best balance in bending and torsion. This results in a board which feels easy to ride at full potential with great comfort. BEHAVIOUR On the water the TRAX HRD Lite Tech offers a smooth, forgiving ride, the HRD rail eliminates spray and feels very comfortable regardless of the water conditions. The flex has been tuned to provide the optimum pop off the water, and the extra flex in the tips really helps to launch you into the air. When it comes to landings, the wide outline and channelled base combine to smooth things out and allow you to retain control at all times. PERFORMANCE The board is so popular because it works for such a wide variety of riders; from experts in freestyle to beginners and everyone in between the TRAX is an excellent choice. Combining early planing, upwind ability and control there is plenty of performance at your disposal when you need it. From flat water to harsh chop the TRAX can handle it, you&#8217;ll get a ride like no other.</description>

These new ROCKET WING CARBON boards group all the advantages of the standard ROCKET WING. Compact and light, they provide stability from side to side, responsiveness and maneuverability, an easy and smooth transition into flight, and efficient pumping abilities. The boards feature a slight concave deck bringing comfort and control. The progressive and straight rocker line allows for better in-flight stability. The sharp beveled rail profile and double concave hull shape will help you be up and flying in no time, and you won&#8217;t be unsettled when occasionally hitting the water or during touchdown. The outline and shorter length make the board maneuverable and easy to rotate around. Most importantly, the HD Foam Carbon Construction gives the boards a strong resistance all while maintaining a light weight and is thus perfectly adapted to the freestyle tricks constraints. The ROCKET WING CARBON is available in three sizes: 4&#8217;4, 4&#8217;8 and 5&#8217;0. This range is mostly aimed at advanced, technical riders looking for a board that will take them to new heights in freestyle or freeride. They are equipped with a full pad, inserts for three footstraps, and the Twin-Tracks system for foil compatibility. *Straps sold separately &#160;</description>

SUPERIOR FEEL AND CONTROL OUR NEW AND INNOVATIVE &#8220;FORWARD GEOMETRY&#8221; WING SURF BOARD DESIGNS, HIGHLIGHT THE DRIVE AND PASSION WE HAVE TO ALWAYS BE IMPROVING AND MAXIMIZING THE POTENTIAL OF EVERY RIDE! The logic behind Forward Geometry is all about the mast track position in relation to the center of the board. The further forward the mast can go the better, it improves maneuverability, response and dramatically reduces the rotational swing weight effect. Combine this with state-of-the-art 320mm Carbon fiber A+System Mast Tracks and you have maximum potential to get your board and foils geometry working for you! Without question, shorter boards offer superior maneuverability, feel and control once on the fly but getting them there is not so easy. Until now that is, as boards get shorter it becomes important to maximise stability and hull speed when still attached to the water. The new Forward Geometry shapes from Armstrong have addressed this issue with a beautiful innovative approach enabling everyone to take advantage of the benefits riding shorter boards. The new Forward Geometry range of boards are packed full of innovation.&#160; Forward Geometry&#8230; Our new A+System Mast Tracks are positioned well forward in the board to reduce rotational swing weight which radically improves handling and response. High strength custom Carbon fiber A+System Mast Tracks&#8230; Plastic simply does not do the job well enough, so we designed our own 320mm Carbon Fiber mast tracks. Recessed deck&#8230; This brings you closer to the mast top for direct handling and feel. Extended waterline profile view&#8230; Speed is the key, so we use all the boards waterline to help accelerate the board forward. Aggressive nose rocker into an accentuated double concave to flat&#8230; This is all about bringing the nose up quickly to accelerate the water down the double concave to flat bottom at the tail. Innovative tail shape&#8230; For better acceleration, less drag at the rear waterline release area, it looks faster because it is! Accentuated chines&#8230; As the board picks up speed and the foil starts to lift, the contact area reduces, making for a smooth transition from on the water to foiling and also seamless touchdowns as the board does not grab as it touches the water&#8217;s surface. Stable Volume distribution&#8230; The recessed deck, wide Chisel nose and relatively rectangular outline means we can push the volume to the extremities, makes for a stable platform when on the water. Light and strong&#8230; Lightweight is nothing without strength so we have chosen the best materials to keep the boards both light and strong. Foam core with multiple PVC reinforcements, Dual Carbon stringers, covered with Carbon fiber and Dyneema cloth.

For many it will be clear in the blink of an eye, the Duotone Click bar 2023 has had a very big upgrade: the long-awaited Click-In chickenloop system. Almost all other brands have already been ahead of Duotone, on this one. That&#39;s because Duotone tested the Click-In system very well before they brought this system onto the market. The new Iron Heart VI Click-In Safety System makes reloading your QR after pulling the safety a walk-in-the-park. Extensive testing has resulted in the Duotone Click-In safety system being one of the best and safest on the market. To make the Click-In system extra safe, Duotone has fitted an indicator on the QR that turns green when the safety system has been reassembled correctly. The upgrade to the click in system is not the only thing that has changed for the new Duotone 2023 Click bar. The V-Distributor is now easier to remove for low V flying. In addition, a Low-V distributor has been added that ensures that there is no more twisting in the PU tubing of the Click Bar when you fly it at low V. The floaters of the 2023 Duotone Click bar are easy to remove from the bar so that you can easily inspect the leaderlines for wear. To complete the picture of upgrades, we also have to mention the new minimalist pigtails that ensure less drag when you fly your kite. As mentioned, a lot has changed with the new Duotone Click bar 2023, but of course many things have also remained the same. The 2023 Click bar still has the super easy depower system on the bar which can be operated with a button at the end of the bar. Ideal for when you can&#39;t always easily reach your depower. The PU depower line that runs through the bar in combination with the super smooth swivel of the QR ensures the very best auto-swivel of your power lines available on the market. The Duotone Click bar 2023 is available in two sizes: S (42cm 20+2m) and M (49cm 22+2m). Both bars are supplied with a 2 meter extension that is already mounted on the 20 or 22 meter line as standard. In general, it is recommended to ride Duotone kites of 10 meters and smaller on a small Click bar, kites of 10 meters and larger are preferred with a 49cm Click Bar. This is of course advice and you can deviate from this based on your kitesurfing style and personal preference. The Duotone Click bar 2023 comes standard without chicken loop. You can choose a freeride kit (the smallest loop, when you are not unhooking), freestyle kit (medium loop, suitable for unhooking), wakestyle kit (very large loop, only for unhooking) and rope harness kit (for rope harnesses). &#160; Features Duotone Click Bar 2023 Duotone Click Bar 2023 S: 42 cm | 20 + 2 (extension) = 22m lines M: 49 cm | 22 + 2 (extension) = 24m lines New Click-In QR New Low-V Distributor New floaters New (loose) pigtails Depower on the bar Super smooth auto swivel FLITE99 lines</description>

DESCRIPTION [Arrow icon] The riders&#39; request is meant to give you maximum protection with minimal material. The foam triangles in the outlaw impact vest are fully stitched through to prevent the foam from shifting within its pockets. The unique triangle pattern of the blocks allows the&#160;foam to be thinner, making this vest less bulky giving you a tighter fit.</description>

<description>
Mystic Stealth Carbon Fiber Bar &amp; Pad which works with the new Mystic Majestic X and Majestic carbon hardshell harness and any harness that uses 1/2 wide webbing straps.&#160; The new stealth bar with the traditional stainless steel kite hook is designed for (unhooked) freestyle and freeride users. The Surf bar is designed to be used with the sliding rope.&#160; This allows more body movement while hooked in. The sizing and shape of the bar is redefined to reduce pressure points while the lever-lock system ensures easy closure and torsion control. On top of that the bar is lighter than the clickerbar 4.0 due to the fiber-fusion composite construction. FEATURES Stealth webbing connector Leverlock Fender-Shield Kiteboarding hook 4 x 25mm webbing setup</description>

What about it The Stealth is an evolution on the well-known Majestic and Legend harness. It combines the stiffness of the BCF (Majestic X) with the non-water absorbing inner shell of the legend harness. Best of both worlds! The harness is built around the patented Bionic Core Frame (BCF), which is a semi rigid back support plate; it&#39;s unique composite material is very stiff yet it allows more flexibility than conventional hard-shells. Features Bionic Core Frame Fly mold 2.0 Non-water absorbing Flexagon Drytech Light weight material Battle belt Flexcovers with integrated safety knife pocket HP system with reinforced guidance holes Adaptive leash eye included</description>

Infos &amp; Characteristics &#160; The &#171; Wing Paddle Attachments &#187; can be velcroed around the wing&#8217;s center strut. They allow for any paddle to be fixed along the center strut, enabling for comfortable&#160;&#8220;deflaters&#8221;. The paddle goes unnoticed, which makes the upwind phase much easier&#160;and more comfortable. &#160; Once upwind, it is easy to release the paddle and deflate your wing, while the Paddle Attachments stay fixed to the strut.</description>

<title>Manera Offshore Vest</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=10342</link>
<g:price>115.0000</g:price>
<description>
Infos &amp; Characteristics &#160; The OFFSHORE is made for those who spend their day out there. It allows you to carry water, a tool, your phone, a snack, safety equipment and much more thanks to its practical and accessible pockets. Its fit is inspired by trail running vests,&#160;hence maintaining a great freedom of movement and mobility of the upper body once at sea. The OFFSHORE&#160;takes up as little space as possible on the water, while still being able to carry a maximum number of accessories, including a wing! Indeed, thanks to its two external straps, it allows you to deflate in total comfort. Once you&#39;ve reached your starting point, sit on your board, fold the wing, open the two straps, and compress the wing outside the bag. What&#39;s more, the often-flashy colors of the wings make you even more visible from afar. We advise you to use the&#160;WING PADDLE ATTACHMENTS&#160;we&#39;ve developed, so that you can secure your paddle along the central strut of your wing. The OFFSHORE bag has paddle attachments, but having the paddle in the wing is much more comfortable. &#160; A word about &#8220;deflating&#8221;: SUP foil downwind is becoming increasingly popular, but the logistics of a downwinder are complicated. Riding upwind with a wing, deflating, and then paddling out is much more practical: no car, possibility of choosing the length of your DW, etc. MANERA has therefore decided to create a light, practical vest adapted to this sport: the OFFSHORE. &#160; *Disclaimer: Downwinding require physical preparation, proper security devices, and assistance at sea. Please do not attempt any downwinders alone or without proper training. &#160; Deflator straps Deflating has never been so easy! Thanks to its two external straps, the Offshore vest allows you to deflate in total comfort: fold the wing, open the two straps, and compress the wing outside the bag. Integrated flashlight Inspired by trail running vests, using light and resistant materials, the OFFSHORE is made to be forgotten. Backpack + Hydratation bag The outside pocket has a compartment for a hydration pack and a large pocket ready for your belongings. Low profile, lightweight, fitted Inspired by trail running vests, using light and resistant materials, the OFFSHORE is made to be forgotten. Whistle buckle The chest release buckle features an integrated safety whistle, which may come in handy if you ever need to be heard or call for help at sea. Front pockets Keep your phone and VHF radio close at hand, on your chest. Paddle attachment We recommend attaching the paddle along the central strut of the wing, but it&#39;s perfectly possible to have it on your back as in a &quot;quiver&quot; thanks to the two straps. Leash attachments The vest features a multitude of leash attachments to secure caps, bucket hats, glasses, phones and other accessories. &#160;</description>

<title>Kite Pump Adapter for Duotone</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=9078</link>
<g:price>8.9500</g:price>
<description>
The PKS North/Duotone Airport&#160; Pump Adapter/Nozzle with double silicone sealing ring is compatible with 2013 and newer North kites, and 2014 and newer Cabrinha kites with the Airlock 2 screw valve. This adapter was built to fit newer model heavy duty pump hoses (2016 and newer.)&#160; The adapter does also fit older model pump hoses (prior to 2016) very tightly but does not lock in like standard OEM adapters.&#160; The adapter can be used as is or may need to be modified by filing down the tiny nub near the ridge of the adapter where it connects to the hose. If you remove the Silicone sealing Rrings, this works perfectly in Core kites as well.</description>

<title>2022 Manera Halo Kiteboarding Harness</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=9232</link>
<g:price>272.3500</g:price>
<description>
Infos &amp; Characteristics It all started from an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of current harness technologies, regarding in particular the softshell (the classic flexible harness) and the hardshell (the rigid shell harness): The Softshell The softshell provides perfect adaptability to the user&#39;s body type and movements. But it becomes distorted under the pressure of the kite: The user&#39;s sides are compressed. It therefore has good adaptability, but little hold. The Hardshell The hardshell does not become distorted under the pressure of the kite: The user&#39;s sides are not compressed. But it has no adaptability to the user&#39;s body type and movements. It therefore has a very good hold, but little adaptability. By separating the functions of &quot;effort management&quot; and &quot;comfort&quot;, we have created a harness that adapts perfectly to your body type and your movements, while offering unparalleled support. KEY FEATURES Adaptive skin Hardshell Softshell Arc spreaderbar Adaptive shell Our Research and Development approach is to create the best possible product, so we have sought to use the advantages of the two current technologies while eliminating their faults. This is how the &#8220;Adaptive Shell&#8221; was born. This patented technology is made up of two main parts: The Adaptive skin and the Hardshell. By separating the functions of &quot;effort management&quot; and &quot;comfort&quot;, we have created a harness that adapts perfectly to your body type and your movements, while offering unparalleled support. Adaptive skin The Adaptive skin is a support skin made of a flexible material providing the user maximum adaptability and freedom of movement. It is directly in contact with the body; its function is to provide comfort. Hardshell The Hardshell is a rigid arc; it prevents the harness from bending and thus compressing the user&#39;s body under the strong pressure of the kite. It is not in contact with the user nor with the back of the Adaptive skin; its function is to manage the mechanical pressure that the harness receives. Durability A product is as durable as the least durable part of its components. The different components of a harness are often non-replaceable (sewn straps, glued foams, etc.) and certainly not recyclable. Therefore, sometimes a worn or damaged part forces you to throw away the entire product. In an effort to reduce our carbon footprint and in order to provide better customer service, all HALO components are assembled without glue or seams so that each part is easily replaceable. We stock spare parts and are able to replace each of them. The ARC spreaderbar, the sliding rope, and the kitenife are included with purchase. Direct contact Thanks to our Adaptive shell technology, and in particular the very adaptable Skin part, there is no longer a need to use large, thick foam for comfort. The HALO&#39;s ultra-thin neoprene foam provides several advantages over a conventional harness: . A more direct feeling . Less bulky contact . Lighter, even when in the water Fitting In order to optimize the customer experience, we have added two sizes: S+ and M+. These two new sizes are in fact the standard S and M harnesses equipped with longer spreaderbars. Why? Bodies may assume different shapes: . A more rounded shape (someone with a big belly) . A more oval shape (someone with wide hips). For the same waist size, we therefore have two completely different body types. By incorporating longer spreaderbars, sizes S+ and M+ are more suitable for people with wider hips. Arc spreaderbar The ARC is a new generation spreaderbar developed to offer a more precise, comfortable navigation experience, with a harness that is better held in place. &#160;</description>

<description>
Committing to overpowered airs and megaloops in gusty conditions demands an unwavering trust in your kite. Our iconic premier 5-strut kite delivers incredible top-end control and allows you to hold down more power than any other kite per square metre. Big jumps. Big&#160;hang time. Big wind range. The Orbit rockets you upwind fast, with effortless steering, extreme boosting and hangtime guaranteed to take your breath away. For 2024 we&#8217;ve smoothed out the shape of the LE, introducing a continuous curved arc that is slightly narrower in the shoulders and wider in the wingtips. It&#8217;s quick. The wingtips have a more bi-elliptical shape for reduced drag and faster turning speed, while a slightly deeper profile in the centre creates more lift. Changes to the wingtip inspired a fully reworked bridle and attachment point positioning, for the most stable Orbit yet. The kite feels even more reliable and forgiving in overpowered, gusty conditions yet retains its ability to fly forward and catch you in kite loops. It&#39;s intuitive. Riders of all abilities can experience the best of both worlds, without worrying about your kite&#8217;s position in the sky. It&#8217;s more responsive in all conditions. In the smaller sizes we&#8217;ve lowered the aspect ratio slightly and refined profiles for improved hangtime and a faster, tighter turning radius for the doubles and S-loops. In the bigger sizes we have updated the profiles for a more lively and reactive feel, with increased low end performance for heavier riders. We&#39;ve also reduced the kite&#39;s overall weight with lighter bladders now in every size. Lighter weight means your kite flies faster, sooner, because you need less wind to get the kite up in the sky. Tested by nature, proven on the podium. The Orbit has your back when the rules of gravity don&#39;t apply.</description>

<title>Manera Vagabond Vest</title>

<g:price>229.0000</g:price>
<description>
New disciplines often imply new risks. Nowadays, wing foilers and downwinders are going further offshore to tackle the best bumps. Be prepared and &#8220;Ready to Escape.&#8221; The VAGABOND Impact Vest has been developed as a minimalistic, highly comfortable vest featuring the necessary tools to go offshore. Compact &amp; lightweight The VAGABOND is designed for riders who want to push their level while staying safe. Made to provide the best balance between&#160;protection and freedom of movement, its thin 15mm foam layer will go unnoticed while riding. We made a vest that you&#8217;ll be happy &#8211; not compelled &#8211; to wear. Compact &amp; lightweight The VAGABOND is designed for riders who want to push their level while staying safe. Made to provide the best balance between&#160;protection and freedom of movement, its thin 15mm foam layer will go unnoticed while riding. We made a vest that you&#8217;ll be happy &#8211; not compelled &#8211; to wear. Cut-resistant jersey We have chosen a specific cut-resistant jersey to avoid any bad injuries due to a kite line, a foil, or anything sharp that you could encounter. Big pockets to travel light Bring your stuff with you, whether it&#8217;s a tool, some snacks, or your phone; the two front pockets will be useful for these long days out there. These are built in airprene, meaning water will instantly leak out if it eventually comes in.</description>

<description>
Infos &amp; Characteristics &#160; The MANERA HARNESS LINE is made out of a spectra core with a special anti-abrasion sleeve. It ensures that the line withstands both traction and friction. &#160;The HARNESS LINE should be attached to the wing handles in order to make sure the harness is well balanced between front and back traction. With its Velcro attachment, you can easily attach it to any wing, and make sure you can swap it from wing to wing in a matter of seconds.</description>

<g:price>149.0000</g:price>
<description>
Infos &amp; Characteristics &#160; LIFT &#8220;lift&#8221;, noun: getting a free ride as a passenger. For us at MANERA, a wing harness is there to go unnoticed when freeflying while providing the necessary support to go back upwind. That&#8217;s why we have developed a light and adaptable harness with a low profile. See it as a &#8220;lift&#8221; back to the top of the downwind! &#160; Do not use for kite or snowkite.</description>

<g:price>449.0000</g:price>
<description>
Infos &amp; Characteristics Having worked on ergonomic designs for a while, our goal was to push our frame concept to more stiffness, allowing a better support of the back &amp; a lower fit.&#160;But something 100% hard was not an option: Our back needs some adaptability &amp; human morphology is unique. So here comes the ECLIPSE, a skilful balance between stiffness &amp; flex that brings support where you need it and the freedom to move the way you want. The harness comes with a standard hook, a rope and a knife.</description>

<g:price>429.0000</g:price>
<description>
Infos &amp; Characteristics It is difficult to improve a harness like the EXO, but the development of the ECLIPSE has taught us a lot and we have used this experience to redesign our star harness.&#160;We applied Adaptive Shell Technology to the EXO model to provide better support, reduced weight and increased durability. Thanks to a stiffer center area, the EXO perfectly supports the back. However, it allows greater freedom of movement thanks to its different levels of rigidity, especially its flexible outline. The soft part of the EXO is built in one &#8220;Single foam&#8221;. The single foam doesn&#8217;t absorb any water, so the harness stays light and comfy once in use. The harness comes with a standard hook, a rope and a knife.</description>

<g:price>469.0000</g:price>
<description>
Infos &amp; Characteristics It all started from an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of current harness technologies, regarding in particular the softshell (the classic flexible harness) and the hardshell (the rigid shell harness): The Softshell The softshell provides perfect adaptability to the user&#39;s body type and movements. But it becomes distorted under the pressure of the kite: The user&#39;s sides are compressed. It therefore has good adaptability, but little hold. The Hardshell The hardshell does not become distorted under the pressure of the kite: The user&#39;s sides are not compressed. But it has no adaptability to the user&#39;s body type and movements. It therefore has a very good hold, but little adaptability. By separating the functions of &quot;effort management&quot; and &quot;comfort&quot;, we have created a harness that adapts perfectly to your body type and your movements, while offering unparalleled support.</description>

Whether you&#39;ve been surfing for years or just starting out, the Primo LTD is the board for you. This board features a wider tail for sharper, more pivotal turns and the crisper channels offer better edge hold while surfing. Run a single center fin for a classic Skim feel or the two outside fins as a Twin surf feel. The LTD Primo comes with pre-drilled inserts and foot straps. Ollies, airs, grabs, spins, and even flips are one step closer to being unlocked. If you&#39;re just starting out, use the footstraps to help you keep your feet in the proper position while learning how to get up. A great learning tool, for sure, but try running without the straps for the ultimate feeling of freedom on the Primo LTD. &#160; Stringer less EPS Foam Single Concave with Quad Channels Squash Tail Dura-Surf Construction Compression Molded Foot Straps EVA Surf Traction Pad Sizes: 4&#39;0&quot; | 4&#39;5&quot; | 4&#39;10&quot;</description>

&#160; The Neo has been synonymous with wave-riding excellence from its inception. Now, in 2024, the Neo Concept Blue embodies our unwavering commitment to versatile, high-performance wave riding. This year&#39;s version introduces an enhanced wingtip shape and construction, improving the handling both on the wave and for strapless tricks. Moreover, the new kite incorporates the groundbreaking Concept Blue, utilising undyed fabrics to reduce water and chemical usage, a bio-based bladder, and recycled plastic components, further underlining our dedication to sustainability.&#160; &#160; The refinements don&#39;t stop there. The Neo Concept Blue&#8217;s construction incorporates an increased area of Trinity TX in the wingtip region, effectively reducing weight without compromising durability. This innovation facilitates exceptional drifting capabilities, perfect for riding down the line. Additionally, the kite&#39;s overall profile receives an update, featuring a slightly deeper centre profile and a moderately deeper profile towards the tips. These modifications enhance the kite&#39;s low-end power and allow for precise wingtip loading, resulting in highly responsive steering. These improvements make the Neo Concept Blue a standout choice for wave-riding enthusiasts, delivering lightning-fast turns and unmatched drift. Its popularity in the wave kite market is well-earned. Versatility remains at the forefront, thanks to multiple settings on the tips that enable you to fine-tune the kite&#39;s performance based on the day&#39;s conditions. Whether you&#39;re embarking on a flatwater strapless freestyle session or conquering the waves, the Neo Concept Blue can be customized for maximum pop and powerful loops or optimized for exceptional drift and rapid turning speed. Another remarkable feature of the Neo Concept Blue is its consistent power delivery across the entire wind range. Abundant low-end power allows you to choose a smaller, more dynamic size, elevating your overall performance. Simultaneously, the Neo Concept Blue offers an extensive upper range with generous depower, allowing you to extend your time on the water even as conditions change.&#160; &#160; With a host of updates and upgrades for 2024, the new Neo Concept Blue sets the bar high, both in terms of performance and sustainability. This class-leading wave kite continues to push boundaries, and all you have to do is get a launch and join the party.&#160;</description>

The new Neo SLS builds on the incredible legacy of the previous years and further enhances the rider experience. Featuring Hybrid Flex Struts, which are now straighter and a wider, squarer wing tip shape show the focus was set on further improving the handling of the kite. The result is a kite with smoother handling, faster steering and a shorter depower stroke, allowing you to dump power instantly. The Hybrid Flex Struts are controlled by the precisely tuned ratio of Penta TX and STW70 adjusted to each size. The percentage of flex material in the tip struts decreases as the size increases. The new wing tips open up and flex when under pressure from the back lines, making for a super fast and near-instant initiation into the turn. The legendary wind range remains, with plenty of low-end power allowing you to get out whatever the conditions, while the top end keeps you on the water for longer. The Neo SLS features a Penta TX and Trinity TX construction, which combines lightweight materials and exceptional durability, resulting in a kite that is noticeable lighter than regular constructions. This weight reduction enhances the drifting capabilities of the Neo SLS, allowing you to execute your moves effortlessly on the wave without worrying about the kite. Even when depowered with the bar pushed away, the Neo SLS maintains its dynamic handling and steering, ensuring you retain full control while riding the wave. The kite&#39;s responsiveness remains unchanged, providing a seamless experience throughout your session. To ensure the kite can be versatile and meet the demands of wave riders and strapless freestylers, the Neo SLS offers multiple settings on the tips, allowing you to tailor the kite&#39;s performance to the specific conditions of the day. Whether you&#39;re indulging in a flatwater strapless freestyle session or playing in the waves, you can set the kite for maximum pop and powerful loops or fine-tune it for maximum drift and rapid turning speed, depending on your preference and the nature of the session.&#160; The Neo SLS has long set a standard for wave riding performance, and this year the enhanced performance takes the kite to new levels, both on the waves and in the air.&#160;</description>

2023 DUOTONE EVO D/LAB FREERIDE / FREESTYLE / WAVE The Evo D/LAB delivers a large performance upgrade to&#160;Duotone&#39;s&#160;most popular kite model. The new Aluula frame construction offers unrivalled durability while delivering substantial performance enhancements. Firstly, the lightweight nature, with each kite saving up to 30% on the overall weight compared to regular kites, means the Evo D/LAB can fly in the lightest of winds. This makes it great for foiling or for light wind freeride; as the wind increases, the Evo D/LAB offers incredible performance for tricks and jumping that you have to experience. Secondly, the handling, thanks to the reduced weight and stiffness of the Aluula material and the pulley-less bridle, the kite delivers the most dynamic ride with great acceleration. The kite reacts to your inputs like an extension of your arms, instantly responding to input on the bar. Powerful loops are at your fingertips with incredible upstroke reaction thanks to the reduced weight. With huge hangtime, the Evo D/LAB delivers an experience on the water unlike any other - at any time you know the position of the kite in the wind window. You will discover incredible power at your fingertips with full depower whenever you need it. The all-new Evo D/LAB is the pinnacle of both technology and design, delivering a unique kite that will offer you performance on the water that will blow your mind. Take the Evo D/LAB for a ride, experience it yourself, and decide if you can live without it.</description>

<title>2024 Duotone Soleil Concept Blue</title>

Description: As a female kiteboarder, it&#39;s essential to have gear designed to suit your smaller frame and weight; otherwise, you will be riding a board that is too stiff and hard to carve. That&#39;s where the new Soleil comes in, a board designed by women for women. With its narrower outline, you&#39;ll have loads of fun carving from rail to rail, while the larger Space Flex windows in the tips ensure you have a smooth ride in all conditions. The top deck has also been changed and is now asymmetrical, focusing the flex on the heel edge of the board, making it easier to edge and pop. For 2024 the Soleil has been added to the Concept Blue range, featuring a more sustainable construction technique that offers plenty of performance. Flax Fibre replaces the traditional glass cloth and offers excellent dampening capabilities for a smooth ride. In addition, Basalt Stringers replace the carbon beam to provide a smooth but engaging ride while being made from natural volcanic rock that is far more sustainable. Ideal for freeride, big air and cruising, the Soleil is the perfect board to help you take your riding to the next level.&#160; Features: NARROWER OUTLINE Specifically designed for women, the narrower outline makes the board easy to ride and gives you more comfort on the water with a smoother ride through chop. FLAX FIBRE WITH SUPERIOR DAMPENING QUALITIES The Soleil uses Flax Fibre instead of traditional glass during the layup of the board; this new material is natural, more sustainable and offers a smoother ride in the chop. ASYMMETRIC DECK This new top deck increases the stiffness in the heel edge of the board, giving a more linear and predictable flex characteristic. SPACE FLEX This technology gives you a smooth ride and early planing and is great for carves too. RESPONSIVE RIDE DUE TO BASALT STRINGERS Basalt fibre comes from volcanic rock, Basalt is a plentiful resource. The Fibre has a low global warming potential as it is a natural fibre. This element of our Concept Blue program replaces carbon as well as glass fibre as a material. Basalt has similar mechanical properties, but a significantly smaller impact on the environment. SMOOTH CARVING The new Soleil design focuses on carving so you can crank rail-to-rail turns with ease, either in the waves or on flat water.</description>

<title>2024 Duotone Click Bar</title>

Description The Click Bar was a game-changer when it hit the market; the design has been refined over the years, and it&#8217;s become the benchmark in kite control systems. For 2024, the Iron Heart VI is back, featuring the Click-In Safety System. This allows you to simply push the chicken loop into the Iron Heart VI for easy connection every time. Perfect for riders using a rope slider bar and a real help when you pop your chicken loop and need to reconnect, especially in the water. The floater is also removable so that you can inspect the leader lines of the bar. The new pigtails have reduced sleeving only where needed. This reduces the weight and the drag through the air at a critical connection point to the kite. The FLITE99 lines from Robline reduce the drag through the air and offer a more direct steering response. The V Distributor III can be adjusted easily, allowing you to set the front-line split quickly. It can also be removed entirely, very easily, so you can have a very low V. This makes the Click Bar compatible with most kites on the market. There is a Suicide Ring leash connection system. Ride it in full safety mode or easily set up suicide for unhooked riding. There is also a Click Bar in Medium with 12m + 12m extensions; this set-up is perfect for kite schools.</description>

<g:price>961.3500</g:price>
<description>
Committing to overpowered airs and megaloops in gusty conditions demands an unwavering trust in your kite. Our iconic premier 5-strut kite delivers incredible top-end control and allows you to hold down more power than any other kite per square metre. Big jumps. Big&#160;hang time. Big wind range. The Orbit rockets you upwind fast, with effortless steering, extreme boosting and hangtime guaranteed to take your breath away. Without changing the DNA of the kite, we&#39;ve engineered it to feel smoother, lighter, faster, and even more predictable in the unpredictable. At North, we understand what riders want in a performance, big air kite.&#160;For 2023 the Orbit feels even more responsive in all conditions. We&#39;ve made small structural refinements to smooth out the canopy, optimizing the profile for less drag, faster forward speed and smoother turning.&#160;Slightly refined bridling means the kite feels more stable and forgiving in overpowered, gusty conditions yet retains its ability to fly forward and catch you in kite loops. We&#39;ve reduced the kite&#39;s overall weight with lighter bladders in larger sizes and introduced a new 2-ply canopy material reinforcement on the trailing edge. The lighter the kite, the faster the steering, the more lift it creates, and the higher you jump. We&#39;ve constructed the leading edge and struts in our lighter N-Dure Dacron to save significantly more weight without compromising strength or durability. We&#39;ve also introduced two additional bar pressure options so you can choose from a lighter, more forgiving feeling in cruise mode, right through to ultra-direct steering with shorter depower travel in megaloop mode. This new fourth setting gives you the confidence to loop the kite even lower. It is ideal for heavier riders on smaller kites and boosts wingtip support on those crazy 40knot + days. Tested by nature, proven on the podium. The Orbit has your back when the rules of gravity don&#39;t apply.</description>

<title>2024 Duotone Sky Surf SLS</title>

<g:price>1899.0000</g:price>
<description>
Our Sky Surf SLS covers prone foiling and radical wing action in two shapes ranging from grom to mid weight ripper. The Sky Surf SLS is the board for our team of young blood rippers sending new moves every day! For 2024 the Sky Surf SLS got finely tuned with the input of Finn and Jeffrey Spencer. The two smallest shapes in our range received a rocker update for better pumping abilities and more balanced foot pressure when being used in the surf &#8211; with or without a wing.&#160; Concave rail bevels make the board easy to grab and duck dive, as well as keeping the rails clear in tight carves. The slightly recessed deck shape provides great stability and an optimized deck angle for increased pumping efficiency.&#160; The 25l 4&#8217;2&#8221; features additional footstrap inserts to adapt the stance even for the smallest riders well below 10 years of age! The 35l 4&#8217;4&#8221; is our go-to board for all prone foilers out there, plus teenagers and lighter pro level wingers pushing the boundaries of our sport!</description>

Description The Sky Style ticks all the boxes for any ambitious winger with the desire for more than just cruising! The Sky Style is widely known amongst ambitious wingers willing to take it further. Our R&amp;D team has refined the previous Sky Style and we&#8217;re offering the two larger shapes of 4&#8217;11&#8221; and 5&#8217;1&#8221; in our Vacuum Sandwich technology level. With a higher rocker in comparison to the Sky Free, the reactions of the Sky Style models are highly responsive and intuitive through increased leverage over the pitch of your foil, making them super balanced and fun to ride from lakes to open ocean surf. The higher nose adds extra room to load up for jumps and with its added volume, it recovers easily - also when landing jumps nose first. The recessed deck of the Sky Style makes starts and sinking the board incredibly balanced even when used in volume below the riders&#8217; body weight. The new rail bevels on the Sky Style shapes add higher clearance during tight turns on the wave face and improve the ability to pump these boards out of the water with an easier release. More parallel bottom contours throughout the mid-section improve the glide to pick up speed for take-off and reduce drag after landings and touch-downs to pop back up instantly. Unleash your talent with the Sky Style!</description>

<title>2024 Duotone Sky Free</title>

<g:price>1499.0000</g:price>
<description>
Description The Sky Free is the quintessential board range for anyone - from newbie to experienced freeride winger! Building on the success of the Sky Wing range, the Sky Free comes with multiple design and construction updates and is offered in a multitude of sizes ranging from 95l to 130l. With an early planing rocker line and balanced and stable floating character the Sky Free is easy to get onto, bring up to speed and into foiling mode for less experienced riders and even for newbies in the larger sizes. Experienced wingers will love the smaller Sky Free models for their light wind abilities. The new feature of moderate rail bevels helps to pump the board out of the water more easily and reduces drag through more parallel bottom contours for incredibly early starts. The deck recess boosts stability and the extra volume in the nose section helps learners to keep the nose up, but also recovers from nose dives of experienced wingers when landing their first jumps. The Sky Free takes you all the way from zero to hero!</description>

<description>
The F-ONE aluminium mast can be used for all disciplines, kite, surf, stand up paddle, wing foil and windsurf. The profile is extruded with precision from 6063 aluminium block. The shape of its section benefits from our years of experience in kitefoiling to provide the best gliding feel while keeping the strength up and the weight down. It comes with two stainless steel helicoil inserts at the bottom and at the top to fasten the connecting parts and is therefore fully modular. The aluminium mast can be used on every foil of the range and it is very easy to jump from one length to another (45 / 55 / 65 / 75 / 85 / 95 cm). A number of parts are available for board connection (Plate, KF, Deep KF, Tuttle).</description>

Description A GRAVITY foil is intuitive. It generates lift at low &#8212;and even very low&#8212; speed but does it smoothly so you can easily keep your balance. The range includes two sizes: 1800 and 2200 cm&#178;. Foils with such areas support an early take-off and more lift and stability. However, we still made sure they also come with enough aspect ratio to maintain a decent speed range and to avoid unnecessary drag. The span is generous, making it a very reliable and intuitive foil. It also allows you to control low speeds and is overall extremely stable. The refined shape details such as the arch curvature, the profile and the wing tips insure it remains highly maneuverable. This GRAVITY FCT range is a fantastic option for anybody looking to discover foiling and wanting to consistently progress. Its durable and sturdy materials can withstand the typical mistakes of the early learning stages, and this foil is overall extremely forgiving. The GRAVITY FCT line is more precisely built with the Foil Compression Technology, a F-ONE innovation that offers impressive mechanical properties. The fuselage can be connected to the standard F-ONE aluminum mast of the desired length. The setup and disassembly are also extremely easy, and the whole is very travel friendly. All in all, this technology provides one of the most accessible and scalable foil setups whilst keeping the DNA of its carbon counterpart. The GRAVITY FCT is recommended with the IC6 300 stab. This stabilizer offers easy take-off and good directional stability for a secure feel which is perfect when riding. Built using the IC6 technology, it is both strong and durable.</description>

CORE SPECTRUM STABILIZER SMALL WING, LARGE IMPACT Even, predictable flight. Easy, steady takeoffs. And super smooth turns. The larger size imparts a more balanced flight behavior at all speeds. The dihedral curvature lets you tilt the foil into turns like a skateboard for a smoother cruising behavior. Gybes, tacks, 360s, and transitions are much easier since you can feel your back wing and use it to pivot the foil.&#160; A high-quality lightweight carbon and PU foam construction is more complex to build than a pure carbon wing but the weight savings is worth it.</description>

The deep mast socket provides a tight, secure connection with your foil. The low profile and slick form minimize resistance during touchdowns. We kept the base as lightweight as possible while adding strategic internal struts to absorb stress from the mast stringers.

Incredible Wind Range Light wind specific Huge wind range, 6-20 knots Tight radius turn for great pop and fun Easy to fly and re-launch even in light winds It&#8217;s incredible wind range allows you to continue riding when the wind increases, this unique attribute sets it apart from competitors. New Rip-stop Material Combination The Zephyr V7 features our new rip-stop material combination. The new rip-stop canopy material has an advanced ultra flex coating improving feedback in gustier conditions making for a smoother ride. The new technical rip-stop dacron is super tough, used on the Leading Edge and Struts it improves strength, durability and longevity. More Fun in Light Winds Having the power of a 17m kite on demand with the feedback of a 13m translates to more fun in light winds. The incredibly nimble handling with a tight radius turn, ease of use and the ability to have fun in low winds characterises the Zephyr. It is perfect for cruising, jumping, air style, honing strapless airs or learning handle passes. The boost is impressive and floaty, with instant power delivery and superior up-wind performance. All-round One-Kite Quiver The Zephyr V7 is the perfect accomplice for when the wind is looking light or unstable, it will get you out enjoying the conditions for any length of time whatever the style you choose to ride. Or if you mainly ride in light wind spots and are looking for an all-round one-kite quiver, this is the kite for you. An all new Fast Flow One-Pump An all new Fast Flow One-Pump Inflation System makes set up and packing quick and easy. It features single point inflation/deflation and a high air flow rate between the Struts and Leading Edge, with clips to seal the hoses to prevent unwanted air flow in case of damage.&#160; Re-launch is surprisingly quick and easy considering its size, simply by turning the bar or using the Re-launch Balls on the leader lines the kite smoothly lifts off the water ready for more action. Exceptional Ozone Factory Construction World-class construction in our own factory, using the highest quality materials and hand checked Quality Control at every step. The Ozone factory also manufactures our Paragliding and Speed Wing range; the same Quality Control processes are used across all products. Designed With OZ-CAD The FUTURE is NOW - All Ozone kites and wings are designed and developed using our own highly advanced custom built CAD software. Our designers are able to work with features specifically tailored to the unique forms and structures of technical inflatable and foil kites and wings. Part of our design team is dedicated to the upgrade of the CAD code and addition of new modules and features to the program as the development of our products continues. 4-line Pulley-less System NO pulleys, NO problems. We design all our inflatable kites without pulleys, to inherit the unique Ozone feeling and performance across our range. All New Ripstop Material Combination The new rip-stop canopy material has an advanced ultra flex coating improving feedback in gustier conditions making for a smoother ride. The new technical rip-stop dacron is super tough, used on the Leading Edge and Struts it improves strength, durability and longevity Internal reinforcements What&#8217;s on the inside counts too &#8211; internal reinforcements for improved strength and durability; such as a Double layered Dacron + Insignia taped Leading Edge closing seam with high strength threads. Double Stitched Folded Seams Sail canopy seams are stitched, folded, and then stitched again for a clean and strong connection of the panels. Load Distribution Panels Dacron reinforcements are used on all loaded areas for enhanced load distribution. This means all loads are spread evenly into the sail ensuring the kite flies and performs at its best. Direct Connect Struts Our Direct Connect construction method improves load distribution between the Leading Edge, Struts and Canopy. Struts are connected directly to the Leading Edge with internal and external reinforcements. This unique construction method ensures clean profiles are maintained with the optimum canopy tension. Reinforced Leading Edge and Struts The Leading Edge and Struts are reinforced in high stress areas to ensure the kite canopy remains in shape and performs at its best. Reinforced Trailing Edge Double layer Trailing Edge strip with an internal light weight Dyneema reinforcement &#8211; this reduces canopy wear and helps to maintain optimum Trailing Edge tension as designed. The Dyneema line also reduces any potential stretch at the Trailing Edge. Low profile aerodynamic Scuff Pads Leading Edge bumpers are often large and unnecessary cosmetic items. At Ozone we build our kites and wings for performance and durability using the best materials &amp; components available. Any areas requiring scuff protection we use a lightweight durable material with superior abrasion resistance, while keeping a low profile in order to reduce drag and maintain performance. Unique bladder construction Our bladders are constructed in-house with advanced custom built welding machines. Double layered sections are applied to any potential wear areas. Anti-Snag line deflectors The Anti-Snag line deflectors prevent bridles and lines from tangling around the wing tip. Safety is increased when launching with a partner and water re-launch is made easier. Fast Flow One-Pump Inflation System The Fast Flow One-Pump Inflation System makes set up and packing quick and easy. It features single point inflation/deflation and a high air flow rate between the Struts and Leading Edge, with clips to seal the hoses to prevent unwanted air flow in case of damage. Back-line trimming options Customise your handling and bar pressure with the back line bridle attachments. Closer to the Leading Edge for slower turn speed and more bar pressure, or closer to the Trailing Edge for faster turn speed and less bar pressure. Fool proof line connectors Fool proof line connectors prevent incorrect rigging of the flying lines to the kite.

<title>2022 Ozone Alpha V2</title>

<g:price>1035.3000</g:price>
<description>
The Alpha is our preformance single strut inflatable kite. It&#39;s simple, incredibly lightweight and very effective - it is a winner for any quiver. The second version offers amazing free ride and hydro-foiling performance for intermediate to advanced riders while the lightweight single strut design is perfect for travelers looking to save on excess weight and packing volume. The Alpha V2 features our new Continuous Curve Leading Edge construction, each segment is now curved to form a perfect smooth arc from tip to tip as opposed to straight segments with angled joints. Transverse Sail Shaping has been incorporated to perfectly match the new Continuous Curve Leading Edge. These latest design features reduce parasitic drag and create a cleaner surface at the most important area of the airfoil. The result is less turbulent airflow, which positively affects the lift to drag ratio increasing overall performance. The Alpha V2 also features our new rip-stop material combination. The new rip-stop canopy material has an advanced ultra flex coating improving feedback in gustier conditions making for a smoother ride. The new technical rip-stop dacron is super tough, used on the Leading Edge and Struts it improves strength, durability and longevity. An all new Fast Flow One-Pump Inflation System makes set up and packing quick and easy. It features single point inflation/deflation and a high air flow rate between the Struts and Leading Edge, with clips to seal the hoses to prevent unwanted air flow in case of damage. Variable Bridle Geometry - quick and easy to change with no extra lines to add or remove. These bridle settings extend the kites operating range, bringing another level of versatility to this outstanding design. Freeride - The ideal balance in performance and feeling for all-round free riding, foiling and wave riding in most conditions. The Freeride setting is the upper knot on the VBG Pigtails (factory setting). Freestyle/Onshore - The kite sits a little further back in the wind window, with increased bar pressure and feedback. If you unhook or prefer a slightly heavier bar feeling this could be the setting for you. It is also favorable for onshore wave riding conditions. The Freestyle/Onshore setting is the lower knot on the VBG Pigtails. Grab a twin tip and go cruising or jumping, you will be surprised at the jumping and looping capabilities of the Alpha; it has smooth lift and hang-time with precise feedback. The lightweight design translates to incredible low-end performance making the Alpha V2 a very competitive choice for light wind free riding and foiling. The power to de-power stroke is progressive and dynamic enough to provide smooth lift for transitions and jibes with a foil board. For high wind foiling in chop or waves, take a small size with shorter lines for loads of fun drifting the kite while carving swells across the wind. In the surf the Alpha is perfect for drift style wave riding as it floats with you. The handling is direct and responsive which allows you to put the kite where you need it. The Alpha is not as dedicated to waves as the Reo, but it still delivers solid performance in cross-shore to on-shore conditions. Water re-launch is easy, by simply turning the bar or using the re-launch balls on the leader lines, the kite will roll over into the re-launch position. Going traveling? Take the Alpha with you, it&#8217;s incredibly lightweight, packs small and can do anything you want to do on any given day&#8230; The Alpha V2 comes standard with an ultra lightweight Compressor Bag, perfect for travelling and day-to-day protection for your kite. It is easy to use and compresses a kite to minimal size. Combine with the Technical Bag to fit multiple kites inside one carry bag.</description>

<description>
Make wet or damp gear management a breeze with the Gus Wet Gear Storage Bag. Inspired by Gus, our resident wind&#160;sports fanatic, fishing enthusiast, and hunting specialist,&#160;this bag has been designed to hold wet wetsuits, booties, soggy towels, and anything else you got wet while playing hard outside.

<description>
The technology evolution for kites, wings, and boards has rapidly improved to enhance your experience on the water. However, perhaps the most critical component required to get on the water -the pump- has remained unchanged since the days of flip phones. Not anymore. Gone are the times of struggling with manual pumping, thanks to the Air Box: Ride Engine&#39;s rechargeable electric pump. Engineered alongside a top electric pump manufacturer, the Air Box has a powerful two-stage system that automatically switches from low-pressure, high-volume pumping to high-pressure, low-volume delivering the fastest inflation possible. Eliminate the worry of over or under inflating your gear when you set your desired air pressure on the Air Box. The smart inflation technology has real-time pressure monitoring, ensuring an automatic shut-off once the pump reaches the selected pressure. Powered by a lithium-ion battery cell, it can inflate four to six kites or wings, and three SUPs on a single charge. SIZE: 162mm x 162mm x 85mm 11.1V.&#160;&#160;&#160; 4000mAh.&#160;&#160;&#160; 44.4Wh. INCLUDES:&#160;Air Box, Hose (3&#39;), 4 Nozzles, USB-C Charging Cable, 12V Car Charger</description>

Assembled in the USA! Inspired by the build quality, performance, and superior comfort of a classic muscle car, the GTR Bamboo All-Terrain marries the best features of old-school deck craftsmanship with the latest technology to produce the ultimate fun machine. Pimped with our newly forged aluminum &#8216;Super Carve&#8217; trucks for the ultimate riding experience no compromise has been made when it comes to strength, durability, and ride quality. The Tech Our new patent-pending Power Flex battery technology and the best 18650 lithium-ion battery cells available provide you with a real-world range of up to 50km per charge in street mode, turning any road or path into the endless wave of your dreams. This coupled with Bluetooth communication is a game-changer for Evolve skateboards as it provides instant power and ultra-smooth acceleration and braking performance, placing the ultimate in intuitive riding control in your hands.&#160; With 3000 watts of twin brushless sensored motor power driving your choice of our new made in USA Evolve GT 97mm inline race formula wheels OR 7 inch all-terrain pneumatic tires, smooth yet responsive performance is at the heart of this machine. The Ride If you&#8217;ve skated before you&#8217;ll appreciate the pop in this deck thanks to our new relationship with one of the most premium deck manufacturers in the skateboard world. The GTR deck is constructed of bamboo with the addition of fiberglass which puts you in the goldilocks zone for flex and strength. Adjust the drop-through truck position to make them closer or further apart to dial in your ride and enjoy the low profile feel, just the way you like it. Whether you&#8217;re into short and sharp or long and deep carving our bamboo deck has a classic longboard vibe and will give you a softer feeling underfoot. But don&#8217;t let that fool you, coupled with your choice of wheels this board is like a cheetah unleashed. Super fast, grippy, and smooth, the Bamboo GTR Street mode is responsive yet nimble and likes to eat hills for breakfast. Corners will turn into apexes, open stretches into runways, and wide open paths will make your list of favorite powder runs! In AT mode this board will come alive when ridden on pretty much any terrain.&#160; From cruising scenic footpaths to shortcuts across huge fields, our pneumatic tires will eat any surface you throw at it. Looking for more of an adrenaline rush? Gravel tracks will become rally stages and that group of grassy hills will morph into a never-ending set of rolling surf breaks. This board will change the way you see the world and the paths you see in it. Optional Extras The Evolve Bamboo GTR 2 in 1 offers even more flexibility for the riding enthusiast than ever before with 2 power USB ports and a new airline friendly swappable battery option for those who want to take their Evolve boards with them when travelling. Now you can also track and share your rides and compete against the world wide community on the new Explore by Evolveapp, along with over the air updates for IOS and Android phones. The Remote and App The GTR Bamboo All-Terrain offers more riding modes than ever before allowing riders of any level to safely enjoy the product and have the ability to adjust your riding mode while riding to suit conditions and maximize efficiency.&#160; Use &#8216;ECO&#8217; mode for easy control and a safe top speed, perfect for beginners and those ridings wanting a relaxed ride with longest ride times.&#160; Use &#8216;PRO&#8217; mode to whizz past traffic and turn your commute into your daily adrenaline rush hour, and if you dare, switch to GTR mode to unleash insane power and acceleration with the ability to climb hills of up to 25% gradient.&#160; For those that want a power curve that is different from ECO/PRO/GTR modes, select CUST (custom) mode on the remote, then open up the Explore by EvolveApp and dial in the power curve to suit your riding style.&#160; In this mode, you can adjust the power to be weaker or even stronger than the stock speed mode settings that come with the R2 remote.&#160; Feel the Difference. What&#8217;s in the box?

Starting at 4&#8217;10 (75l.) and going all the way to 7&#8217;11 (185l.) the line includes boards for all sports and all types of riders. They are developed following the same sizes &amp; outlines as the rigid boards, they offer great stability with the extra volume brought by the inflatable technology. The foil position is also identical to the rigid boards and provide the same perfect balance for take-off and in flight. The 4&#8217;10 and 5&#8217;4 can be used for surfing, kiting, wing surfing and are also ideal to have fun doing some wake foil. The 5&#8217;4, 5&#8217;10 and 6&#8217;6 are ideal sizes for Wing foiling with a Swing, offering a variety of volumes to suit every one. The 7&#8217;2 is dedicated to wingfoiling, it is the ideal size to start the discipline. The 7&#8217;6 and 7&#8217;11 are the real Swiss Knife boards, ready for all sorts of fun: SUP foil, Wing foil, Windfoil, Wing surf. They can also be used to play or paddle without the foil. The 7&#8217;2, 7&#8217;6 and 7&#8217;11 includes 2x US tracks where additional fins can be plugged. In this configuration it becomes the best platform to learn how to handle the Swing (our hand-held wing) before learning how to foil later on. The Rocket Air boards are built using higher grade dropstitch with a fused, twin layer shell and a specific dropstitch pattern bringing extra stiffness which is essential to control the board properly when foiling. The weight of the board is incredibly light which makes them easy to handle and a lot of fun, even for advanced riders. Finally, the Rocket Air boards can all be stored in a small bag to be easily brought on for your next adventure. DROP STITCH An incredible technology developed originally to make inflatable rescue airplanes! It was later on used by inflatable boat and canoe manufacturers. It is composed of a vertical stitch in-between the deck and the hull that keeps them parallel and extremely rigid. This allows the boards to be inflated up to 21 PSI. This bulge is inherent to the &#8216;drop stitch&#8217; technology used in the manufacturing process of your board, and doesn&#8217;t constitute a defect. Also, it does not affect in any way the behavior and/or reliability of your board.&#160; 4-PT FOIL MOUNT Waterproof box Connected to the deck 4 x M6 &#8211; 15mm tapered head 2021 F-One Rocket Air SUP w/ Inserts Only fits M6 90x160 foils &#160;Accessory Checklist Included Not Included Track Hardware x Foot Straps N/A Board Bag x &#160; The Rocket Air range is a line of inflatable board dedicated to foiling sports: Surf-foil, SUP-foil, Wing-foil, Wind-foil and even Kite-foil. &#160; Easy to store and carry Balanced and light for flying Superior and extra stiff Dropstitch material Sizes: 4&#39;10&quot; / 5&#39;4&quot; / 5&#39;10&quot; / 6&#39;6&quot; / 7&#39;2&quot; / 7&#39;6&quot; / 7&#39;11&quot; &#160; F-One Rocket AirStarting at 4&#39;10 (75L.) and going all the way to 7&#39;11 (185L.), the line includes boards for all sports and all types of riders.

Wing Foil Wheel Bag SIZES 5&#39;0 / 5&#39;5 / 6&#39;0 - 160X65 / 170X75 / 180X85 X24CM Info &amp; Characteristics New sports means new boardbags! The foil and wing equipment is distinct from kite or surf gear, and it is thus logical and necessary to protect it differently. Our FOIL boardbags are made to travel. Equipped with 100% high density foam with a thickness of 10mm, they protect your gear even in harsh travel conditions. A rigid divider separates your foils from your boards so they don&#8217;t damage each other. Finally, soft wheels allow for effortless transport on any surface.</description>

These hollow leashes are perfect for foil surfing or wing foiling. These leashes float, which prevents them from getting caught around the foil. It also comes with three movable EVA floats to keep the end of the leash from sinking and getting wrapped on the foil. These leashes are good up to 8&#39; swell and feature a removable neoprene cuff. Replace the cuff with the Dura-cord line, and it attaches perfectly to our wing waist leash. It comes in 7&#39; Strait and 7&#39; coil options.&#160;</description>

NEW STOCK JUST ARRIVED MONDAY, JULY 25th! GET THEM NOW BEFORE THEY RUN OUT! &#160; STRIKE V2&#160; Much more than a wing !&#160; Includes: wing, bag, manual and wrist leash &#160; Wing foil sensations are beyond compare. The feeling of freedom you get from being the only connection between the wing and the foil is unique. It is thus essential to make the correct wing choice to enjoy the full experience. The STRIKE V2 and its improved design will give you even stronger sensations, no matter your skill level. Adaptive Wing Design: Controlled power, Performance and Comfort Pre Loaded Canopy: Our unique canopy tension allows the wing to keep its shape at all times Perfectly balanced center of traction between your two arms Legendary lightness, essential for freefly Dynamic stability for a fully controlled ride Exceptional forward traction to increase upwind and reduce fatigue Extended wind range guaranteeing performance and control in all your sessions New sizes from 2.5m to 5.5m Adaptive Wing Design While the industry trends towards the &#8220;all-rigid&#8221;, we have developed the Adaptive Wing Design, a unique concept offering the perfect balance between performance and comfort. &#160; It is difficult and uncomfortable to handle a stiff, handheld wing in the high end, especially without a harness. A wing must be able to absorb that power, just like the mast bend or the opening of the leech in windsurfing or the depower in kitesurfing. The STRIKE V2&#8217;s Adaptive Wing Design transforms every gust into positive energy. This new wing is designed to adapt through a controlled deformation that allows the preservation of a high-performance profile throughout the entire range of use. &#160; To reach this result, we worked on the leading edge and modified the shape of the central strut. Its cut is now segmented, allowing for an improved control of its curve and its deformations. We also enhanced the wing&#8217;s twist. &#160; The Adaptive Wing Design enables a perfect control of the traction. The wing adapts itself to the riding conditions while maintaining an unprecedented stability. It releases power when necessary and takes the shape it needs in any given wind without degrading the quality of the profile. Materials Standard materials like Dacron and Polyester are still perfectly suited for exploring the Adaptive Wing Design&#8217;s world, and both offer a huge range of design possibilities. Our experience and the feedbacks received on our previous designs have allowed us to better analyze the structural and reinforcement needs of a wing. The STRIKE V2 will be even more solid and durable. &#160; Pre Loaded Canopy From the beginning, our wings have had a unique canopy tension that can be compared to that of a harden up windsurfing rig. Our wings are therefore &#8220;pre-tensioned&#8221; and made to adapt. This ideal tension of the trailing edge when riding guarantees much better performances upwind and in light winds.&#160; &#160; Center of traction Throughout our entire development process, we took great care of the center of traction&#8217;s stability, so power&#8217;s distribution is always balanced between both arms. The wing is stable and barely requires any adjustments from your front or back hand, thus offering maximum comfort.&#160; &#160; Handles Our wings are quite literally at your fingertips. Right from the start, we picked handles with a small diameter and a rectangular shape, with flatter parts that fit right into your phalanges. You don&#39;t have to firmly grasp the handles constantly. &#160; Once again, we went for softness instead of rigidity, so you always have the perfect angle between the wing and your arms. As our wing is already extremely stable, rigid handles weren&#8217;t necessary. With our softer, lighter, more comfortable, and well-thought-out handles, you won&#8217;t hurt or exert yourself, nor damage the canopy while packing your gear. &#160; Weight - Control &#8211; Stability The STRIKE V2 keeps the V1&#8217;s incomparable ultra-light weight that is pleasant in all phases of flight. Stability is improved by respecting the profile and the wing&#8217;s center of traction while in motion. The traction is constant and homogeneous. This improved in-flight stability allows you to keep better control of your foil and your trajectories, no matter your skill level. The Strike V2 provides smooth and precise steering abilities and works for you thanks to the Adaptive Wing Design. The tensions of the fabric and profile&#8217;s distribution are improved. A new panel orientation along the warp line offers a better control and extended durability by ideally adjusting the fabric in the right direction. The infill is kept to a minimum to ensure profile control without adding weight, and to maintain a good field of view. The STRIKE V2 will be inconspicuous during your free flying sessions so you can fully focus on your surfs or on the swell.&#160; &#160; Fast Forward One of the unmatched qualities of our wings is that they pull you forward, not sideways. The traction of the STRIKE V2 has been improved particularly for strong winds: you only need to sheet out to feel the power decrease and the traction go forward. It offers great navigation comfort upwind and allows you to push the limits of the high end with less efforts. In the low end, the traction is steady and does not require any adjustments. Just sheet in and the wing works for you. &#160; Performance With its unparalleled upwind capabilities, the STRIKE V2 will increase your free flying time or help you win races. Its speed performance also allows you to jump higher and to benefit from an excellent lift for landings. Its compact design, with less wingspan than the V1, offers more possibilities for tricks and a more comfortable navigation with your hands positioned lower. &#160; Freeride Through its constant traction, control, lightweight and stability, this wing is perfect for freeriding no matter your skill level. Its power and pumping efficiency are its strengths to get planing and exploit the low end. &#160; Expanded wind range and its advantages We work extensively on the range of use of our wings to guarantee a great planing start and the possibility to ride in light wind. Simultaneously, we wish to push each size as far as possible in the high end to keep your riding flow in any conditions. &#160; &#160; &#160; What are the advantages? A single wing is enough to give you a full range of use and comfort of navigation when the wind drops or picks up during your session. Gain more lift during jumps and enjoy smoother landings while keeping the same wing size in the high end.&#160; Start planing earlier, and thus reduce the volume and size of your board. &#160; New V2 sizes The ideal minimum area of a wing can be 2.5m and the maximum 5.5m without using our 3-strut CWC patent. The STRIKE V2 will therefore be available from 2.5m to 5.5m, and will offer a new size distribution with: 2,5 m - 3m - 3,5m - 4m - 4,5m - 5 m - 5,5m&#160; &#160; This could also allow heavier riders to choose among 3.5m &#8211; 4.5m &#8211; 5.5m, and the lighter ones to pick between 3m &#8211; 4m &#8211; 5m.&#160; &#160; A STRIKE V2 is passion, smooth performances, power and control, lightness, strength, and durability.&#160; Its dynamic stability in flight makes everything easier for you while on your foil.

SWING V.2 The original feeling of the SWING has been greatly improved. Learn wingfoiling faster with the SWING V2. This brand new wing offers more lightness and comfort while being very accessible as well as performing for all riders! The SWING has been known for its incredible lightness. The V2 comes back with an even lighter feel. Perfectly balanced &#160; Easy planing and upwind performances &#160; Maximum comfort and accessibility &#160; Offering pure enjoyment is at the heart of this new SWING&#8217;s design. It is not a matter of pure performances nor the jumps&#8217; height. It has been designed to offer the lightest feeling possible and generating efficient power to allow foiling in all conditions with maximum stability and ease of use. &#160; The power&#8217;s distribution has been improved and is perfectly balanced in order to save arms fatigue. &#160; The instant power generated by the wing as well as its neutral balance, makes it a fantastic wing for all riders no matter their level and ways to practice. It has been designed to offer a flex which greatly improves the comfort. The SWING V2 is a fantastic light wind wave riding wing. &#160; Its new design benefits from the STRIKE&#8217;s innovations. Its stability and durability have been improved thanks to its vertical panel orientation along the trailing edge inspired by the STRIKE. We have used our well-known light weight and high quality materials as well as our exclusive design to get a super sleek canopy. We have made the choice not to add the unnecessary accessories to keep the weight as low as possible. &#160; The SWING V2 has 2 comfortable handles located in the crucial spots to allow the rider to have the perfect balance and there again to lower the overall weight of the wing. They have been optimized to offer ease of use in transitions and the best tuning. Their excellent feel encourage longer sessions. &#160; Its remarkable low weight will make you forget about it when in free fly mode and when riding swell. The SWING V2 has improved all of its original features: simplicity, comfort and stability. Riding in the low end will have never been so enjoyable and is exceptionally intuitive. &#160; The SWING V2 is available is 2.4, 2.8, 3.5, 4.2 and 5 m to suit all needs.&#160; Specifically designed for kids and lightweight riders, the 2.4 is the ideal wing to learn and enjoy the sport!</description>

NITRO ULTRA-RESPONSIVE, ULTRA-LIGHT, ULTRA-DURABLE The immediate responsiveness makes the Nitro feel like it has half a square meter more power. Starting at well under 1.5 kg, the ultra-lightweight is something you feel instantly. The extra stiff struts create control and a wider wind range, so you can enjoy the wing in more wind conditions. The key to the Nitro is the new Ho&#8217;okipa Ultra PE high pressure leading edge and strut, with our proven Ultra PE load frame. Airush and Starboard have a combined 50 years of chasing responsiveness, lightweight and durability. Today, the FreeWing Nitro is the best example of this yet. &#160; &#160;</description>

In a category all its own the Slingshot Dart sets a new standard in wings.&#160; Finally, a hard charging speed machine capable of rocket airs and unlimited hang time.&#160; Push the Dart and the Dart pushes right back.&#160; Designed to escape the monotony of low power wings meant for cruising swell, The Dart is an animal all its own. Speed records will be set, hang time will be counted.&#160; If you are done drifting down swell and want to take your wing straight to the stratosphere, pushing boundaries in every dimension...grab a Dart and set your target.&#160; &#160;&#160; WHY WE MADE IT: Winging is entering a new phase of radical maneuvers and our team riders were ready to escape the monotony of wings made primarily for drifting. The Dart was designed specifically for, HIGH SPEED, HUGE JUMPS, and BACKFLIPS.&#160;&#160; The Dart&#8217;s Delta shape provide riders lightning-fast acceleration and the ability to penetrate into the wind to meet any swell, anywhere, with full power.&#160; The massive hangtime and loft our team demanded when jumping this wing is a result of the differential pressure rolling over the huge LE and into the extended dihedral canopy.&#160; We also wanted a wing with a shorter wingspan to help-out or shorter riders and allow the wingtips to clear the water in next level spins and flips.&#160; WHY YOU&#8217;LL LOVE IT: You are a winger that has put in your hours and are ready to take it to the next level of tricks and riding.&#160; &#160; Harness line attachment points: You might need to hook in to bring that heart rate down&#160; Soft Neoprene under LE Handle:&#160; Prevents knuckle rub while luffing&#160;&#160; Handles free from rough seams:&#160; For a smooth long ride&#160; Package Includes: &#160; &#160;Dart Wing, Wrist Leash, Backpack &#160;</description>

MOST WANTED AND STILL RUNNING 15 years after the birth of the first BANDIT, the F-ONE design team has once again put an astounding amount of work to create the best kiting experience for all riders. Jump higher, perform your favorite tricks at ease, improve your ride. The connection between the rider and the kite has never felt so natural. &#160;Impressive stability no matter the conditions &#160;Absolute control at all time Amazing responsiveness for epic sensations Precision flying with an excellent range and efficiency &#160;Improved boost, hangtime and kiteloops Effortless upwind abilities The BANDIT is incredibly stable in the air, no matter what the wind is doing. Its fantastic control allows you to perform to a high level in all areas. The kite translates gusts into forward pull. Improve your big air moves with the new BANDIT. The kite loop is quicker this year with a tighter turning radius, allowing you to dial in as much or as little intensity as you might want. You get a total support from your kite, therefore the landings are softer as you get that extra lift before you land. The impressive instant steering response offers precision flying with the best balance between ease of input and feedback impulses from the kite. This results into a very linear feel with zero stalling. Experience the fabulous BANDIT feeling of the steering and the sheeting working so beautifully together. The BANDIT XV offers improved hang time, pure jump height and vertical boost. It requires fewer skills and efforts to load the kite before sending it. Going upwind is easy and comfortable, it will charge you back upwind after trying new tricks and big jumps! Thanks to its legendary Delta C-Shape, the only still patented kite design, the kite offers incomparable bar feeling, the best relaunching ability and exceptional stability. The leading edge has been redesigned with one more segment and a new diameter for optimum maneuverability and stability. The new double vertical panel around the trailing edge, the double canopy trailing edge and the lighter Dacron between S1 and S2 offer the sleekest profile for the most stable flight. Reinforcement and the construction overall has been improved to gain even more control. Most Wanted for 15 years and still running, the BANDIT never fails to impress.</description>

<description>
As a kitesurfer, you know the feeling, you get to the beach to discover the forecast wasn&#8217;t telling the truth, and there is less wind than predicted. The parking lot is full of dejected kiters doing a wind dance. Luckily, you&#8217;re packing the new 2022 Juice. You pump it up, launch it into the sky and feel the power. Within minutes of arriving, you are carving lines into the ocean, popping airs and practicing your tricks. How is this possible? Years of intense research and development to create the ultimate light wind kite using the most up to date materials available. It&#8217;s the kite every kiter needs, the one our pro riders go to in a pinch and the kite that delivers the most bang for buck when the wind doesn&#8217;t play ball. Perfect for light wind freeriding, the smaller sizes are fantastic for foiling, while the larger sizes have been tweaked to offer maximum power to twin tip riders wanting to perform tricks. Some light wind kites are slow and sluggish; the Juice is a Formula 1 car in a car park full of trucks. The Flex Struts help the kite to respond instantly to rider input, giving a dynamic and exciting flying experience not often found in larger kites. With light bar pressure and reduced drag on the airframe, kitesurfing becomes an effortless pastime where you can forget about the kite and concentrate on the next trick. If the wind picks up, no problem, the Juice&#8217;s wide wind range can handle it, and you&#8217;ll discover more speed, power and even bigger jumps with massive hangtime. The Juice is the kite to have in your quiver to ensure you have a fun session every time you head to the beach.</description>

<g:price>1440.0000</g:price>
<description>
Details If you want the ultimate in performance across the widest range of disciplines, the all-new Evo SLS is the kite you need in your quiver. Built using the SLS construction and materials, including the incredibly lightweight and durable Penta TX, combined with Trinity TX to shave up to 15% of the kite&#8217;s weight compared to regular models. It&#8217;s not just about making the kite light, though; the construction also makes the kite stiffer, which improves the flying characteristics in every area. You get more pop, and better take offs along with huge hangtime. The handling is incredibly dynamic, helped by the new Flex Struts, allowing the kite to twist resulting in significantly faster and tighter turns. The pulley less bridle means less maintenance and better handling, especially when throwing kite loops. Total control is right at your fingertips at every stage of every trick as the kite becomes an extension of your body. The weapon of choice for riders looking for a high-performance versatile kite, the Evo SLS performs no matter your riding style. Big air, freeride, hooked freestyle and wave riding are all a dream with the new Evo SLS, except this is a perfect dream that you can revisit every time you hit the water! &#160; &#160; Features: THE PERFECT PERFORMANCE ALL-ROUNDER EASY TO ACCESS, HIGH-PERFORMANCE NO MATTER YOUR RIDING STYLE, GREAT FOR BIG AIR, FREERIDE, HOOKED FREESTYLE AND PLAYING IN THE WAVES. AGGRESSIVE LIFT THE EVO SLS DELIVERS INCREDIBLE TAKE OFF SPEEDS, LIFT, AND FLOATY HANGTIME THANKS TO THE RIGID FRAME AND DIRECT AND DYNAMIC STEERING. IMPROVED LOW END THE NEW FLEX STRUT DESIGN HELPS THE KITE TURN AND CLIMB FASTER THAN EVER BEFORE, VASTLY IMPROVING THE LOW-END RANGE. SLS CONSTRUCTION THE SLS CONSTRUCTION HELPS REDUCE THE OVERALL WEIGHT OF THE KITE. IN ADDITION, HIGH PERFORMANCE MATERIALS, SUCH AS THE PENTA TX FRAME AND TRINITY TX CANOPY, MAKE THE KITE UP TO 15% LIGHTER COMPARED TO REGULAR MODELS, WHILE OFFERING EXCELLENT DURABILITY. PULLEY LESS BRIDLE SYSTEM THE PULLEY-LESS BRIDLE SYSTEM OFFERS A MORE DYNAMIC AND DIRECT FEEL TO THE KITE AND A LONGER-LASTING AND MORE DURABLE BRIDLE FOR HARSH USE. MULTIPLE TIP TUNING OPTIONS TUNE THE KITE TO YOUR RIDING STYLE, INCREASE THE TURNING SPEED OR SLOW IT DOWN, INCREASE OR DECREASE THE BAR PRESSURE, AND FLY THE KITE HOW YOU WANT TO FLY IT.</description>

<title>Manera SFOAM Helmet</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=10235</link>
<g:price>89.0000</g:price>
<description>
We always refused to make bulky, hard helmets because they are very uncomfortable to wear in the wind and horrible to surf with. They could even be dangerous as they make the impact in the water even harder for your neck. &#160;The S-FOAM helmet uses an innovative material that allowed us to create a soft, fitted helmet that is very comfortable to ride with. &quot;Smart&quot; Foam S-FOAM (Smart Foam) is made of a&#160;non-Newtonian fluid&#160;that is soft and flexible at normal state, but instantly becomes stiff when subject to an impact. This means you have a&#160;perfectly fitted, comfortable&#160;helmet when riding, but&#160;it will protect you&#160;when needed. Perfect fit Our innovation here relies on the 3D construction. The helmet is&#160;molded into one piece, instead of just trying to assemble a flat pattern into 3D (think standard rugby soft helmets full of bumps and stitchings). The S-FOAM HELMET leaves no area unprotected and&#160;perfectly fits your head, creating a helmet-free feeling while riding. &#160;</description>

2022 Cabrinha Macro Air Inflatable Wing Board INFLATABLE WING FOILING Foil specific board with focus on maneuverability and easy launch Sizes:&#160;4&#39;7&quot; X 24&quot; X 4.8&quot; - 80L / 5&#39;3&quot; X 28&quot; X 4.8&quot; - 110L / 5&#39;9&quot; X 32&quot; X 4.8&quot; - 140L / 6&quot;4&quot; X 35&quot; X 4.8&quot; - 170L One of the most appealing things about wingsurfing is the freedom. Freedom to ride how you want, freedom to ride what you want and freedom to ride where you want. &#160; The Macro Air helps with the latter by giving a premium wing foil board in a compact inflatable package that can fit in the back of any car, or can be carried on any train. Through the use of the exclusive Synthesis Foil Mount which fuses the upper and lower skins of the board together, we have created the most responsive and highest performing board in this market segment. Turning input and trim is unparalleled in the inflatable realm thanks to the foil plate, which allows the rider to have direct input from their back foot, through the mast, as opposed to relying on threads or rails on a normal drop stitch board. &#160;</description>

HIGH PERFORMANCE Sizes: XS220 / XS300 The best part of the last 5 years has been the rise in hybrid development and crossover technology amongst sports. No where is this more evident than in foil boarding. The hydrofoil has become the common denominator in all of the surf and wind sports today. Therefore, it reasons that its important to have a hydro wing-set capable of crossing between sporting genres with flawless performance and capability. Enter the X Series&#8482; wings from Cabrinha. The design of the X Series&#8482; recognizes and exploits the most important features needed in all hydrofoiling genres. Lift, efficiency and control are the three pillars that drive the X Series&#8217; high performance and buttery smooth ride. Through a combination of outlines and wing profiles the X series delivers a smooth lift and stable flight with precise turning and control. The X Series&#8217; efficiency is enhanced by our all new Cab Fusion mast and fuselage ecosystem. The Cab Fusion is a redesign from the bottom up to remove any unwanted &#8216;play&#8217; in the system while streaming the connection between the wings and the fuselage. The resulting increase in stiffness and reduction in drag puts the X Series wings into an all new class of hydrofoils. DESIGN PROFILE Swept LE, Straight TE, Lean profile, minimal anhedral with downturned tips. WING FEATURES Optimal efficiency and lift Flat center, to downward tips, for perfect balance between locked-in feel and agility Recessed design for minimal drag Full prepreg carbon construction EPS core for superior strength to weight ratio TECH SPECS 220 cm^2.

XR7 Features Earn your wings with the XR7&#39;s precise flight control and new lighter build. After six years, our signature canopy material receives a major upgrade. CoreTex 2.0 now features massively improved tear resistance in both directions, slight weight savings, and a new emulsion that improves flight, durability, and longevity. New Exotex Light struts, iterational shape, and bridle improvements have our R&amp;D team telling us the XR7 is more turny and playful than ever. The XR&#39;s legendary linear responsiveness continues to deliver effortless cruising, record-breaking hangtime, and super smooth landings. After seven generations, we&#39;ve dialed in the characteristics most kiters are looking for. Like prodigious power. Unbelievable depower. And precise control on the water as in the air. New! CORETEX&#174; 2.0 TRIPLE RIPSTOP CANOPY: Improved durability and UV protection. EXOTEX&#174; ULTRA RIGID DACRON: Zero stretch leading edge. New! EXOTEX&#174; LIGHT STRUTS: Super tough yet lighter than the original. 5 STRUT FRAME: For maximum canopy stability. DELTA BOW SHAPE: More power and even more depower. INTELLIGENT ARC: Adjustable wingspan on demand. SHORT BRIDLE SYSTEM: Improved kite feedback. CIT MODES: Customizable &#8220;power steering&#8221; and turning speed INSTANT RELAUNCH: Effortless water relaunches. SPEED VALVE 2: Fast, reduced effort inflation. SPEED PUMP SYSTEM: Improved all strut inflation. SENSOR BAR READY: Calibrated for all Sensor bar systems. 6 YEAR REPLACEMENT PARTS AVAILABILITY XR7 LW Features More muscle. Less weight. This is the new XR7 LW. The trusty lightwind performer that brings out the best of you. The XR7 LW inherits all the power and ridiculous wind range of the legendary XR7 while receiving noticeable weight-saving upgrades like ExoTex Light struts and leading edge. And we swapped out the canopy material for CoreTex 2.0 that gives the XR7 LW more punch. The XR7 LW&#8217;s DNA is packed with innovative technology like CoreTex 2.0, ExoTex Light, and Intelligent Arc that supercharges its performance. CoreTex 2.0 improves tear resistance, durability, and most importantly flight stability. CORE&#8217;s exclusive ExoTex Light Dacron reduces leading edge weight while maintaining its shape in gusts. And Intelligent Arc massively expands its wind range. We could go on, but we prefer that you find out for yourself how you and your squadron can rule the light wind skies with the XR7 LW. New CORETEX&#174; 2.0 TRIPLE RIPSTOP CANOPY: Extreme durability and UV New! EXOTEX&#174; LIGHT LEADING EDGE: Reduced weight. Improved Low-End. New! EXOTEX&#174; LIGHT STRUTS: Similar strength and durability. Just lighter. ULTRA LIGHT WINGTIPS: Super responsive wingtips. 5 STRUT FRAME: Maximum canopy stability DELTA BOW SHAPE: More power and even more depower. INTELLIGENT ARC: Adjustable wingspan on demand. SHORT BRIDLE SYSTEM: Improved kite feedback. CIT MODES: Customizable &#8220;power steering&#8221; and turning speed. INSTANT RELAUNCH: Effortless water relaunches.

<g:price>919.2000</g:price>
<description>
F-ONE has put all its experience in foil and wingsurf&#160; designs to create the ideal board which will suit most of the wingfoil riders needs. With its compact length and light weight, the board is responsive and ideally suited to cruising or surfing on a foil, a wing in your hands. Fun and responsive Stable and forgiving Durable and user-friendly At 5&#8217;10 for 110L. the board has enough volume and width to make it possible for most riders to stand-up easily as well as making sure that riding back to the shore is possible, even when the wind drops. Its dimensions are ideal for an easy progression. Using some straight rocker lines for an easy take-off and a wide tail outline for an optimized volume distribution, the ROCKET WING ASC features a sharp beveled rail profile to make the release easier during take-off and the touch-down smoother when the board hits the water again. In other words, you will be up and flying in no time and you won&#8217;t be unsettled when occasionally hitting the water. The ROCKET WING ASC is equipped with a recessed handle for easy carrying, a full pad for comfort and with the twin track system on the bottom to connect with most foils on the market (4-bolt plate system). It is built around a light core made of eps foam injected into a specific mold carved to its own shape. This core is then laminated with fiberglass and epoxy resin into another mold and wrapped inside a protective shield skin. This shield, made of polymer, is both ultra-thin and very durable.</description>

<description>
The Slingshot B3 trainer kite is the perfect learning tool for the sport of kiteboarding! It comes with everything you need in order to learn how to become a kiteboarder or just have fun at the park or beach. Even&#160;if you already know how to kiteboard this is the perfect thing to have for all conditions and to&#160;introduce friends to the sport. The Slingshot B3 trainer is the most popular for adults. It delivers power and pull similar to the larger inflatable kites. It comes complete with the control bar, safety leash, flying lines and bag.&#160;The Slingshot Trainer Kites have a proven reputation as the best trainer kites ever produced and they are easy to fly. These kites are durable, forgiving and provide a background in basic flying skills. Most people that learn kiteboarding have little experience with kites. Many come from a background of similar sports like: water skiing, surfing, bodyboarding, skimboarding, wakeboarding, and snowboarding.&#160; Even though these sports are related, kiteboarding is significantly different and requires instruction.&#160; Here at Jupiterkiteboarding we recommend that you start with the basics of kite flying and always follow the safe kiteboarding guidelines. Jupiter Kiteboarding believes strongly in the use of trainer kites. These are smaller kites which you can purchase and fly before taking a lesson. Although trainer kites comes in several sizes, they are much smaller on average than the inflatable kites that are used on the water for kiteboarding.&#160; The main skill to master with the trainer kite is steering while maintaining correct body posture.&#160;Once the trainer kite has been mastered we recommend taking a lesson with one of our IKO or PASA certified instructors.&#160; On average 3 &#8211; 9 hours of instruction is required to get up and going on a board. (Sorry, we cannot accept requests for specific colors.&#160; Kite in photo may not be color that is shipped.) The first step in learning to kiteboard is becoming familiar with how a kite flies. Here is how you can learn from the safety of the beach with the Slingshot B2 Trainer Kite. &#160;</description>

The &#8220;RS&#8221; stands for Race Speed Series. These are the fastest wings in our collection. These wings are great for racing when downwind paddling or winging. They are very fast, and turn and pump well. The RS wings are slightly thinner than the GT&#8217;s, which gives them the extra speed. They also cross over to waves with SUP and prone riding. The RS1000 is now a favorite for team rider Kaden Pritchard and Max Moquin on their prone set-ups for both, surfing and prone downwind. They use it to dock start as well!

The V2 has been deisgned to be stiffer and stronger while maintaining excellent maneuverability. The fuselage has been shifted forward 50mm for more lift and glide. The chord is 3mm thicker than our V1.5 mast, giving it more stiffness and responsive ride.&#160; The cross foil section of the mast has changed to a racing profile for speed and smoother performance. Four&#160;new holes have been added for more possible plate adjustments. Sizes : 70cm, 75cm, 80cm, 90cm, 100cm</description>

NL means NEXT LEVEL !!! If you want more speed, more grip in &#160;radical turns, then go for the NL. Thinner profile for more acceleration and top speed. Need some experience to enjoy it! Part of the new High-Aspect series, the NL or Next Level is built for high performance. &#160;Ideal for advanced surf/sup riding and all levels or wing foiling, these take efficiency and top speeds to the next level. &#160;They are ready for all that you can throw at them and respond with precision. These wings feature the new 1.5 series construction with shiny finish for lighter weight and more streamlined glide. &#160;This new series is compatible with all Gofoil Mast/Fuselages and should not require much fitment like A-la-carte wings had in the past. For maximum top speed, we recommend using the pedestal and high aspect 18&quot;, 17.5&quot;, 14.5&quot;, or 12.5&quot; stabilizers. However, if you want more lively turns you can use the Kai stab. &#160;If more slow speed stability is your goal, then pair it with as Maliko stabilizer.

The foils of the Gravity line are designed to provide a solid lift with a smooth take-off and great carving potential.Right in the line of its best-selling carbon sibling, this new Gravity is the ideal foil to get started and progress in wing-foiling and surf-foiling. A Gravity foil is an intuitive foil to use. It generates lift at low (and even very low) speed but does it in a smooth way so you cankeep your balance easily. The wings are designed to be easy to roll and turn, so they can perform in the surf. The Gravity has its dimensions optimized to provide enough lift to get anyone flying. We made sure to keep the drag limited to maintain a thrilling feeling of glide. The span is generous making it a very stable foil and the refined shape details such as the arch curvature, the profile and the wing tips insure it remains highly maneuverable. The wing is covered using a thin but strong protective layer to protect it from scratches and digs. It is built in fiberglass around an injected foam core and fits on a streamlined, aluminum fuselage. The two connect via a large, solid plate at the front of the fuselage ensuring a very solid and stiff bond between the wing and the fuselage. The fuselage can be connected to the standard F-ONE aluminium mast of the desired length. The setup and disassembly are also super easy and the whole is very travel friendly. The Gravity comes with the IC6 300 stab. This stabilizer offers easy take-off and good directional stability for a secure feel which is perfect when riding. Built using the IC6 technology it is both strong and durable GRAVITY 2200 FCT The foils of the Gravity line are designed to provide a solid lift with a smooth take-off and great carving potential.

Our 2022 foil range is our most comprehensive, modular, and accessible one to date. Here is our guide to help you choose your F-ONE foil. Keep in mind that your setup will vary depending on your skill level, your weight, the conditions, and your chosen program. ASPECT RATIO The Aspect Ratio (AR) is key to understanding how we constructed our range of foils, and it should be your first guide in choosing a front wing. The AR is the ratio between surface area and wingspan. Overall, foils with a low- to mid- AR will be a bit thicker and rounder. They are more stable, turn and pivot well, have plenty of lift, and will help you take-off easily at low speeds or in low wind conditions. Those with a high AR will be thinner and longer, and thus produce less induced drag. They are highly efficient and will provide a lot of glide and speed. The higher the AR, the better the foil performs for experienced riders and the further it flies. However, it also requires more minimum speed to start planing and develop lift. The AR also influences the turning radius of each foil. With equal areas, a higher AR makes wider turns. Finally, there is also a link between the swell period and the AR of the foil. The longer the swell period, the more AR you need. RANGE PRESENTATION &amp; PROGRAMS For this new collection, we based everything on aspect ratio. As we started designing and trying out high aspect ratio foils, we discovered they opened new programs and new possibilities. We have classified our range in four levels of AR to define a program for each foil: An AR of 5.0 is the most accessible and is recommended to learn how to foil. The most versatile and best performing is the AR 6.0. Its medium span guarantees maneuverability for surfing and accessible pumping. When you switch to an AR of 7.0, you increase your maximum speed and will glide further, but the extra span penalizes the maneuverability. The AR of 9.0 and above is reserved for experienced riders. It offers incredible glide if you maintain sufficient speed and brings good maneuverability under 1000cm&#178;. &#160; HYDROFOILS OVERVIEW Front Wings For kite foiling, we have three models. The ESCAPE (AR 6.0) is aimed at high-performance kiting and speed, but can also be used by experienced riders to surf big waves. The MIRAGE (AR 4.5) is a versatile foil, great for freeriding and carving. The IC6 950 V.3 rounds up the range with its 4.4 AR and is intuitive, predictable, and very user-friendly. Our range of foils for wing and surf foiling has considerably expanded this year. It starts with the GRAVITY and its AR of 5.0. It is the foil you should have if you want to learn how to use both a wing and a foil. Accessible and straightforward, the GRAVITY foils have great lift and stability. If you already have some experience with a foil and are looking for more performance and glide, the versatile and must-have PHANTOM foil (AR 6.0) is for you. It is a fantastic foil that does everything well. Its medium span guarantees performance, maneuverability for surfing and efficient pumping. Everybody should have a PHANTOM foil in their quiver. As you continue improving and want to change up your ride, a foil with a high AR will bring more speed, great carving capabilities, and more acceleration. The new PHANTOM S, with an AR of 6.5 and surface areas below 1000cm&#178;, have a thinner profile than the regular PHANTOM to give you more speed and maneuverability. If you&#8217;re a surfer, then the handling, maneuverability, and carving abilities of this foil are made for you. Both PHANTOM and PHANTOM-S are also perfect for freestyle wing sessions. If you want more glide, even more speed, and fantastic upwind potential, then the SEVEN SEAS is for you. Moving into open seas, its AR of 7.5 makes it great for surfing the swell and downwinding on small chops or in light winds. Its optimized design for minimal drag will also reduce the traction in your arms as you travel upwind with a wing. Finally, the EAGLE and its AR of 9.5 will let you fly incredibly far and fast. Its thin profile leads to minimal drag, and brings an unmatched and seemingly endless glide. Whether in freefly or downwind, you will be able to go much faster, further, and longer. Its stability and impressive control will let you fully focus on the entire experience. The EAGLE will transform your session once you have the level to ride it as fast as it needs to enjoy its full potential. This foil is a completely new way of using the sea and the swell. Every chop is becoming more powerful; everything brings more sensation. Stabilizers The stabilizer is just as important in your foil setup as the front wing, and we truly believe the future lies in its development and innovation. The stab undoubtedly influences the behavior of the entire foil. Simply changing it while keeping the same front wing can boost your ride and bring about completely different sensations and performances, as if you were on an entirely different setup. For example, beginner wing foilers will want to look at the C275 or R275 stabs (AR 5.3), which will be a bit slower but more stable, before moving on to the C250 range and its 6.1 AR. Then, with its 8.8 AR and incredibly thin profile, the DW210 is truly made for speed and downwind. Some of our stabs also have generous winglets, like the IC6 300 for kite foiling, which offers even more stability on the yaw axis and fantastic control. A rider shouldn&#8217;t be afraid to switch out and try out different stabs to gain performance, speed, glide, turn radius or stability, depending on the conditions or chosen program. Obviously, the choice of stab needs to stay coherent with the rider&#8217;s level and intentions, as not all will match with all front wings. Fuselages Just like a bigger or smaller stab will influence your ride, so will a shorter or longer fuselage. Changing the size of your fuselage will help as you go from one front wing to the next. For example, you will lose a bit in maneuverability going from a PHANTOM to a SEVEN SEAS. However, you can gain some of it back by simply picking a shorter fuselage like our Carbon Fuselage XXXS. Finally, the length of your fuselage influences the pace of pumping as well. A shorter fuselage will require a bit more effort and a faster pace in pumping to get up and start flying. Masts The mast connects the plane (front wing, fuselage, stab) to the board. It will also be easier to learn wing foiling or kite foiling on a shorter mast. The falls will be gentler, and you will feel more stable as you learn to get up and stay up. A shorter mast is also ideal for sessions in shallow waters. A long mast offers more leverage and is good for choppy conditions. With a higher mast, you have more room to angle the foil and make aggressive turns in the waves without the foil breaching. CONSTRUCTION &amp; TECHNOLOGIES We offer three types of constructions on our foils: Carbon (pre-preg and High Modulus), FCT, and Injected Carbon. All our carbon hydrofoils are made from pre-preg, which makes them incredibly strong and stiff. Some of our foils, like the EAGLE or the ESCAPE, have an added layup of High Modulus Carbon fiber that leads to even more rigidity in both bending and torsion while keeping enough comfort for any kind of practice. Our GRAVITY and PHANTOM foils are available in both carbon and FCT (Foil Compression Technology). FCT foils are built in fiberglass around a high-density foam core. The wing is then covered by a thin and strong shield skin. This F-ONE innovation offers impressive mechanical properties, making it particularly suited for foils subjected to high stresses and bending loads. As you are riding, the difference between a carbon and FCT foil is barely noticeable. Both have the same shape and program. FCT foils do have a bit more flex, but the performance potential on the water is very much the same. The IC6 950 V.3 is built with the Injected Carbon Technology, consisting of an injected polymer reinforced with carbon fibers. This technology makes these foils a lot more resistant and durable.</description>

<title>Quickblade Stingray 72 SUP Fixed</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=10228</link>
<g:price>579.0000</g:price>
<description>
The Stingray is a revolutionary new shape that will change the paddling world as we know it. The blade is only 10 inches long (25cm) which is half the length of most traditional blades, the reduced blade length reduces the catch and exit time by 100% as it takes half the time. The reduced blade length allows the center of area of the blade to be just 3.5&quot; from the tip of the blade giving it a more distinct snappy catch and release. This blade has a thin foiled shape that at 12 degree angle to the shaft is designed to have some &quot;winged&quot; effect as you drive it into the water making the blade literally want to go forward as you make the catch giving you extra length on the power phase of the stroke. What is unique about this thin foiled shape is that it performs a similar effect in reverse as the blade starts to exit from the water it wants to thrust forward slightly and efficiently all of the way to the exit. To maximize the &quot;winged&quot; foil effect of the blade, we developed a special unique all carbon shaft that is tapered on both ends, providing minimal drag below the pulling hand and having a little more flex at the top hand by the handle, while having a slight oval shape where you hold it with the bottom hand. We created a very comfortable hollow carbon palm grip that comes standard on the Stingray, or you can custom request our carbon T-handle if you prefer. We believe based on Initial testing of the Stingray that it is so efficient it has increased boat traveling speeds by 1-2%.</description>

Info &amp; Characteristics Our most technical boardshort of the range is now built in coconut fibers! Coconut is widely used in the food and cosmetic industries, and once the inner portion has been used, the shell is just thrown away. We turned these coconut fibers into activated carbon, which happens to be a fantastic boardshort material. (See the technologies below) We use a PFOA/PFOS-free durable water repellent, as these chemicals are very persistent and harmful to the environment once released in the ocean. - MID LEG 20&quot; -</description>

Info &amp; Characteristics Our bamboo Poncho has been considered the best for quite a while now. We did not make any compromise during its conception and used 550gsm high-quality fabric only. We now offer a 30 percent lighter alternative for summer or for traveling, so we have designed the Summer Poncho with the same bamboo fabric in 380gsm. We chose bamboo fabric for mainly two reasons: The Bamboo material has many great characteristics: Ultra soft feeling Absorbs water three to four times better than a regular cotton Dries twice as fast as other materials Naturally bacteriostatic Naturally hypo-allergenic And a reduced impact on earth Grows without fertilizers and pesticides Bamboo farming needs four times less water than cotton Absorbs 30% more CO2 than a tree, creates 30% more oxygen Prevents deforestation: Can grow 1 meter per day Prevents erosion because of its long roots</description>

Whether you like freeride, wave/foil or even occasionally want to unhook or kiteloop, with the Ozone Enduro V4 it is all possible! The Enduro V4 has been completely redesigned using Ozone&#39;s latest construction technology and design software features. As a result, ozone has taken the performance of the Enduro to a higher level. The Enduro has been one of the most popular all-round kites on the market for years for every style and all conditions. This year, the brand is introducing a new Continuous Curve Leading Edge construction and Transverse Sail Shaping. Each leading edge segment is now curved, creating a perfectly formed arc from point to point and resulting in a very smooth character in all conditions. The Ozone Enduro V4 2023 is equipped with Teijin TechnoForce Triple Ripstop canopy, which ensures a very strong construction. Thanks to the 4-line pulley-less system, the kite has a very direct steering behavior, but also a very good depower and relaunch.

Kiteloops are a breeze with the new Ozone Enduro V4 as it spins easily on its axis and then climbs straight up. &#160; Specifications Ozone Enduro V4 2023 Exceptional Ozone Factory Construction Teijin TechnoForce Triple Ripstop canopy Teijin Triple Ripstop dacron Continuous curve Leading Edge 4-line pulleyless system Internal reinforcements Overlapping flat seams Direct connect struts Reinforced leading edge and struts Reinforced trailing edge Aerodynamic Low Profile Scuff Pads Unique bladder construction Aligned bridle geometry Fast-flowing inflation system with one pump Anti-flap soft battens Back-line trim options Foolproof line connectors Technical bag</description>

<g:price>119.9900</g:price>
<description>
&#160; We had a certain set of requirements when it came to designing our ideal helmet for the water. The result is the Vandal Pro, crafted from ABS Shell to handle high impact. Comfort was big on our list, and the Vandal Pro is extra lightweight due to the EPP impact foam, which doesn&#39;t absorb any water. The inside has got an ergonomic shape, mesh comfort lining and an adjustable 360 dial, a unique feature that fastens the helmet around the entirety of your head instead of just the back. The Fidlock closure is magnetic, making for a quick release to round off this CE approved helmet. -: 360 dial adjuster -: Mesh comfort lining -: Fidlock quick release chin closure</description>

<description>
FurTher improving producT longeviTy And Flex chArAcTeriSTicS, The new A+SySTem iS deSigned wiTh cuSTom TiTAnium BArrel nuTS.&#160; &#160;The new system locks the mast and wings to the A+System TC Fuselage while maintaining our unique flex characteristics. The flex you can feel in the system comes from the carbon/titanium fuselage itself and our tapered Reactive Flex Mast construction, which is at the heart of the smooth flowing Armstrong feeling. Our new custom titanium 8mm barrel nuts lock into longer 28mm screws that connect across the full width of the mast and front foil to fuselage fitting, for improved durability and performance. We&#8217;ve streamlined, strengthened and simplified the rear wing connection by attaching the tail wing directly to the A+System TC Fuselage and combining the current TTF shape directly into the fuselage. For most riders this means a simple, direct, shim-less connection of the tail wing. For more experienced riders our new Polycarbonate Pro Shims can easily be added to tailor your rig to your exact requirements and feel.&#160;&#160; The Polycarbonate Pro Shims also allow riders to take full advantage of our cutting edge &#8220;Forward Geometry&#8221; boards. Our boards&#8217; mast tracks are positioned well forward compared to other brands. This means a reduction in swing weight up front for faster response and better snappy handling. By applying the Polycarbonate Pro Shims, you can find that perfect balance under foot even with the mast at the front of the tracks. The A+System Tc Fuselage and wings are fully compatible with all existing hS and cF parts (wings, masts and tail wings).*We have devised a simple but very effective A+System upgrade drilling kit. All current front wings and masts can be retro drilled so riders can take full advantage of the new system upgrades with just the purchase of the new fuselage. Q&amp;A 1:&#160; &#160; &#160; What is the&#160; a+system? The new A+System has been developed by Armie to handle the new generation of mid to high aspect wings, which produce massive torsional leverage forces. To improve durability, longevity and performance the A+System has full width Titanium Barrel Nuts across both mast and front wing connections to lock them in position. The tail wing connection has been simplified, streamlined and strengthened and now incorporates a simple polycarbonate shim system. 2:&#160; &#160; Which parts of the&#160; a+system&#160; foil Kit are different from the current&#160; foil Kits? The A+System TC Fuselage is the heart of the updated kit. We have added threaded screw inserts for the new Titanium Barrel Nuts and the tail area is updated so that the tail wing now fits directly to the fuselage. A+System front foils and masts have an extra hole to accommodate the new Titanium Barrel Nuts. The screw set is updated with slightly longer screws and Titanium Barrel Nuts. 3:&#160; &#160; Will my current Kit be compatible&#160; With the&#160; a+system parts? All current HS and CF front wings, tails, fuselages and masts are compatible with the new A+System parts.&#160; &#160;Front wings and masts can be upgraded with our drilling jig kit to accept additional Barrel Nut connections. ALL current TC fuselages will accept the Barrel Nut on the front wing but not on the mast as it passes through the titanium core so it is not possible to retro drill and tap this. 4:&#160; &#160; When&#160; i&#160; buy&#160; a+system front and tail&#160; Wings,&#160; Will these fit my current system? Yes - And you will be able to use the new Barrel Nut system on the front wing with your current fuselage. 5:&#160; &#160; if&#160; i&#160; buy a neW&#160; mast,&#160; Will there be a hole that&#160; i&#160; can&#8217;t screW&#160; a bolt into? Yes, but it will not affect riding performance. The A+ system mast has an extra screw hole for A+ system screw and Barrel Nut, which is factory threaded through the Titanium Core of the TC fuselage. 6:&#160; &#160; if&#160; i&#160; buy just an&#160; a+system&#160; fuselage are my current&#160; Wings and mast upgradable? Yes, with the drilling kit it&#8217;s possible to retrofit both mast and front wings to take advantage of the A+System&#8217;s full potential. 7:&#160; &#160; if&#160; i&#160; buy just an&#160; a+system&#160; fuselage,&#160; Will the tail&#160; Wings&#160; i&#160; have&#160; &#160;be compatible? Yes, all current tail wings will fit the A+System fuselage directly without the need for the TTF and they are compatible with the new Polycarbonate Pro Shims. The new A+System tail wings&#160; are more streamlined at the connection area, for improved performance. 8:&#160; &#160; What about the&#160; shims? We have simplified the tail connection area so that for most riders the tail can be directly attached to the fuselage with no shim. For more advanced riders wanting faster, looser setups we have new low profile Polycarbonate Pro Shims, which allow more than 5 angle settings at 0.5 degree increments. 9:&#160; &#160; Will the&#160; Warranty be valid if&#160; i&#160; drill into my existing parts for the&#160; a+system upgrades? Yes, providing you purchase the drilling kit and use the jig and parts supplied. If for some very unlikely reason a part needs to be warrantied, we will expect to see proof of purchase of the A+System drilling kit.</description>

You want to fly any kite on the market, with the same Control Bar, from 4 m2 to 14 m2? 4 or 5 lines? Inflatable or foil kite? The&#160;Totem Vario 2023&#160;is the true universal bar that can do it! Any kite brand, any kite size! It takes only&#160;2 seconds&#160;to change the spacing between the steering lines. You can&#160;speed up your kite&#160;or&#160;slow it down. The only bar on the market to offer such versatility. &#160; The new 2023 Totem Vario features: coated depower throw new floaters new choice of colors: red blue or green blue The red blue Totem Vario will be available in January 2023. You can order now the green blue Totem Vario. We will ship it with the 2022 floaters and will ship you the 2023 as they become available (around mid December) at no extra charge. The depower throw is&#160;PU coated&#160;(polyurethane tube). The PU is made in France. If you prefer a&#160;textile coating, just request it: we can provide it. The textile coating is more suited for very cold temperatures. A screwable stopper ball is set below the Clamcleat to protect it. The new floaters are stiffer. An elastic means &quot;sticks&quot; the floaters onto the bar ends, pointing towards the kite. The Totem Vario is set up with the&#160;AKA 3&#160;chicken loop. This new version comes with an&#160;antichoc protection&#160;under the bar, to better protect the grip&#160;below the bar. This brand new&#160;Totem Vario&#160;is the latest evolution of the famous Totem control bar: -&#160;adjusting the width&#160;of the back leader lines has never been&#160;so easy: just untight the connectors and slide them in or out! - the&#160;foam bar ends&#160;will better protect you and your board in case you fall - new&#160;high quality dyneema lines&#160;with very low stretching greatly improves the reactivity of the kite The Totem Vario was designed by the best engineers in the kitesurf industry. The bar is produced in the same factory as the premium brands.</description>

<title>2023 North Code Zero Kite</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=9723</link>
<g:price>759.8500</g:price>
<description>
Borrowed from our North sailing heritage, Code Zero is the name of a sail born to go fast in light, shifty conditions. Like its namesake, we&#39;ve engineered this kite for performance in very light air. The all-new Code Zero is a light, fast and reactive single-strut performer with effortless one-handed control and efficient light wind power delivery. It flies and turns quickly - with excellent drift and manoeuvrability which makes it ideal for foiling and small surf. One of the lightest single-strut kites available, the Code Zero has a playful and agile feel with dynamic steering. Refined for weight savings, we&#8217;ve stripped back the kite&#8217;s construction to the essential. Using lighter N-Dure&#160;dacron on the leading edge and strut for stiffness and durability, a double-canopy layer to reinforce the trailing edge and lighter-weight bladder material in every size. DuraLite wingtip chafe protectors provide abrasion resistance only where you need it, and small battens on the 9m and 11m stabilize the canopy. Super fun and easy to fly, with intuitive relaunch and reverse launch, the Code Zero is also great for learning to kite or foil in light winds. The kite is stable and evenly tensioned, with a balanced geometry. It won&#39;t luff, over-fly or front stall, and its one-handed steering means you can always foil in your preferred stance. The Code Zero is a highly efficient kite with a wide wind range and impressive power delivery for a one-strut kite - which means you can ride lighter wind conditions with a smaller kite. With the 3, 5, and 7m, you&#39;ll cover the whole wind range, from 10 to 30 knots.</description>

<title>2023 North Mode Wing</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=9763</link>
<g:price>876.8500</g:price>
<description>
For high-speed performance, efficiency is key. The Mode, our new high-speed performance wing, incorporates N-Weave woven fibre technology, 3x stiffer and 40% lighter than traditional leading-edge materials, for the most efficient power delivery on the market. N-Weave reduces structural deflection and transfers wind&#160;energy into greater forward speed, explosive boost and hangtime for freestyle tricks. Development of this new material technology has allowed us to create a stiffer, lighter and more durable wing without geometric compromise (and without the high-performance price tag). The Mode has a fast, VMG-optimized design, which lets you sail closer to the wind, on higher upwind angles, and reduces your need to tack or gybe, so you reach the mark as quickly as possible. We designed the Mode primarily for high-speed performance, but the stiffer airframe also translates into unprecedented loft for higher jumps and forward momentum on landings. With incredible high-end stability, the 4.2 and 5.5m are ideal for use in stronger winds, while the 7m is optimised for greater power in lighter air. The wing has a balanced lower aspect ratio with rounded wingtips to reduce tip strike, and the new panel layout delivers wingtip stability and increased tension under load. Featuring rigid&#160;GripLock&#160;micro-trim&#160;control handles for immediate response, and new race-window positioning to help you keep a close eye on your opponents.</description>

<title>2023 North Carve Kite</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=9762</link>
<g:price>889.8500</g:price>
<description>
The Carve is a powerful, reactive and controllable kite, ideal for carving up a wave face, tucking into a barrel or boosting strapless tricks. Engineered with a stable, lower aspect ratio design for fast pivot turns and excellent drift, the Carve has an&#160;extremely direct feel in both bar pressure and steering initiation. For 2023, we&#39;ve put the Carve back into its wave riding category. Refined bridling for a longer, more progressive travel means the kite feels smoother and more responsive throughout the full depower range. It is still reactive when you sheet out &#8211; to the very end. Improved overall balance also enhances drift, so when you&#39;re surfing, it glides down the line, waiting for your bar input. More intuitive control - especially when the kite&#39;s not visible on a big bottom turn, cut back, or in a barrel - means you can focus 100% on the surf. The Carve has a slightly reduced leading-edge diameter and thinned-out profiles. This gives the kite smoother power delivery, improves the high-end wind range, and helps you ride deeper in the pocket for longer. The kite won&#39;t pull you aggressively off the rail, and you&#39;ll have softer landings when doing big jumps. The 2023 Carve will also relaunch faster in critical situations. We&#39;ve introduced lighter bladders in all sizes and a lighter 2-ply canopy reinforcement. This reduces weight and helps improve the turning speed in light wind while maintaining the Carve&#39;s surf-tough durability. The Carve now flies faster, generating more power and board speed. It rockets upwind. Experienced riders will benefit from the kite&#39;s impressive power and efficiency, while intermediate riders will find it offers a smoother, more user-friendly ride. Freeride and Strapless Freestylers will love the improved hangtime and catch for kite loops and softer landings.</description>

Infos &amp; Characteristics The FOIL LEASH is a very short, elastic leash that can be flattened, which makes it comfy even when pumping with the leash under your feet. It doesn&#8217;t touch the water, doesn&#8217;t get caught in your stab, and doesn&#8217;t pack useless stuff like swivel and metal parts that a standard surf leash needs.</description>

Ozone V7 Reo Kiteboarding Kite Any wave, anywhere; this is your go to surf performance kite. Wave riding specific design Improved low end and wider performance range Transverse sail shaping for cleaner and tighter canopy Super direct with improved response and range before luffing Instant power, faster handling, huge de-power and insane drift WHO IS THE REO V7 FOR?&#160;-&#160;Good intermediates and beyond. It&#8217;s faster, smoother and has a bigger range. This is a kite for riders with waves on their mind. The quick turning, crisp control and excellent drift performance also works excellently for freeride foilers who need a kite that will remain highly responsive in as much of the wind window as possible. WHAT&#8217;S NEW ON THE V7? New refined design and sail control Transverse sail shaping results in a cleaner aerofoil for increased performance Reduced drag and more drive through the window Smoother handling in gusty conditions Improved low end Thinner bridles than on V6 for reduced parasitic drag and weight Being more ruggedly built than the Ultra-X version, the meatier material on the V7 is better suited to riders who may regularly rig up and launch / land on more abrasive beaches. The smallest sizes may also be preferable for anyone riding in stronger wind conditions when the extra durability can add peace of mind, at which point the lighter weight materials on the Ultra-X will have less effect on overall performance. WHAT YOU FEEL: Incredible pure wave performance handling Excellent drift and reduced drag Very crisp feel at the bar Faster response and more range, particularly in the low end More drive through the window Reduced tendency to nose dive at the edge of the window when lines slacken Later luffing means better feedback and handling across a greater wind range Excellent stability wherever the kite is in the wind window More feeling, more feedback, more control ORIGINAL REO DNA &#8211; WITH IMPROVED RANGE AND BETTER FEEL The Reo V7 features an evolved combination of design features that will help your wave riding improve. Maintaining its low aspect three-strut platform, the V7 offers super fast turning response with rapid but silky smooth movement through the window and a handling sweet spot that&#8217;s now even wider in its wind range. The cleaner and tighter aerofoil has also improved the low end, which is now markedly better in the V7. Luffing later, you&#8217;ll enjoy even more predictability and clean feedback from the kite across a wider range of winds before the canopy is compromised. Of course, superb drift and float overhead remain key characteristics that have also been improved.</description>

Ozone V7 Reo Ultra X Kiteboarding Kite Ultra-light, ultra-quick, ultra-responsive and ultra-reliable Applying new but proven lightweight and stiff performance materials, tested across a three year period, has led to the next evolution in the Reo&#8217;s stunning legacy. Next level wave riding specific design High performance, light weight materials for ultimate handling in surf Super fast and direct feedback, even at the edge of the window Mind blowing drift and slack line control Transverse sail shaping for tighter canopy and huge range WHO IS IT FOR? This second model released alongside the Reo V7 is a razor sharp, laser focused wave kite designed for riders searching for ultimate performance. The Ultra-X model is designed around the same transversely shaped canopy and air frame skeleton as the Reo V7 but features a 20% lighter dacron and 17% lighter canopy material. This may be one of the lightest pure wave kites on the market, but it&#8217;s not all about weight. As ever our primary focus was on aerodynamic performance and the Ultra-X is stiffer throughout, offering increased drift, reduced nose diving at the edge of the window in radical surf and lightning fast, super-crisp response. BUILDING FROM THE V7 BASE Broken down, the Ultra-X is built around the new V7 framework. There have been many subtle tweaks to stitching lines and panels applied to these designs since the V6 model, but the biggest improvement in canopy tautness has been achieved thanks to transverse sail shaping on the leading edge, improving your sense of sail control. Applying the experience of our paragliding design colleagues, the V7 framework features an extra seam in the sail running close to the leading edge, which allows for more true 3D shaping. Not only have we managed to add more profile curvature, we&#8217;ve also added more strength in the high lift zone thanks to that extra seam. Drift performance and responsiveness at the edge of the window in slack line situations is perhaps the biggest appeal to those searching for true surf performance. While the Reo has always been a pure wave performance machine, all of these lightweight performance handling gains offer huge advantages for the freeride kitefoiler, too. ULTRA-X MATERIALS LIGHTER WEIGHT PERFORMANCE DACRON -&#160;The leading edge and struts are not only 20% lighter than 160g standard dacron, but is also more rigid. Also used on our new Flux V1 wing, this new 125g performance dacron material guarantees a longer lasting shape but also allows for more responsive handling and a tighter canopy for more aerodynamic performance gains. LIGHTER WEIGHT CANOPY -&#160;Utilising the weight saving properties of the latest 46g double ripstop Teijin cloth (17% lighter than a 55g standard triple ripstop) further contributes to the increased drift performance in particular. The performance coating ensures high levels of strength and durability at a reduced weight. BRIDLES &#8211; COMPLETING THE FULL EXTENT OF THE MISSION&#160; -&#160;As we continue to discover ever increasing aerodynamic performance, further gains are achieved through the use of a Technora line material for the bridle lines that&#8217;s 25% lighter and 25-35% thinner to further reduce drag throughout all areas of performance. WHAT YOU FEEL: Incredible pure wave performance handling Sensational drift Ultra-quick steering response and drive through the window Reduced tendency to nose dive at the edge of the window when lines slacken Later luffing means better feedback and handling across a greater wind range Excellent stability wherever the kite is in the wind window More feeling, more feedback, more control Lighter weight kites feel lighter and more responsive on the bar More performance and stability especially in light winds Packing volume is decreased</description>

Ozone V5 Contact Water Kite Control Bar Click-In Loop Push-away quick release with an innovative one-step Click-In reload function that is incredibly intuitive. The release handle fits comfortably in the hand, it is quick and easy to activate the release by pushing the handle away. A self-positioning release mechanism locates automatically, ready to be re-loaded by simply &#8216;clicking&#8217; in the loop. The Click-In Loop is AFNOR NF S52-503 certified. Ergonomic EVA Grip 3D pressed EVA with ergonomic shaping and a lightly sanded finish provide the ultimate bar grip. It is color coded with the leader lines and flying lines for an added visual safety feature. Design Inspiration What&#8217;s the first thing you do when you get in a car? You click in your seatbelt, hearing that &#8216;click&#8217; sound makes you feel secure that you are safely buckled up, and you know instinctively how to release it. The design of our innovative quick release system, the Click-In Loop, was inspired by the same principle. In the same way fastening your seatbelt has become a natural action when getting into a car, riders should activate and reload their release systems before and after every use. Although this important safety check is often overlooked, checking your release before each session will ensure it is functioning properly. We developed the Click-In function to be simple and intuitive, so activating and reloading will become second nature.

<description>
SIZES 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 PERFORMANCE FEATURES + Great drifting ability + Unrivalled steering response, even when depowered + Incredibly powerful with massive depower + Smooth and comfortable feel + Quick, round turning + Easy water relaunch + Good jumping ability for strapless freestyle &#160; TECHNICAL DETAILS + Proven original construction in LE and struts + Geometry tuned to size, so less sweep and wider arc in big sizes; more sweep and narrower arc in smaller sizes. + Profile tweaked deeper in the middle for power + Several tip tuning options + Four or five line set up (5th line not included) The Neo is the benchmark in kiteboarding in waves, incredible drift, total control at all times and the ability to perform to podium levels in the waves and for strapless freestyle. For years the Neo has been the wave kite against which all the others are measured; the unique combination of power, control and drifting characteristics have made it the wave kite everyone wants to ride. As strapless freestyle has evolved as a discipline, the kite has developed too. There are the tuning options soft, medium and hard, allowing you to set the kite up for the day&#39;s conditions and your personal preferences. In the hard mode, the kite delivers a powerful loop that is easy to control, while the soft mode enhances the turning speed and the drifting capabilities. The legendary drift has made the kite incredibly successful in the waves; this, combined with unrivalled steering response, enables the kite to perform in both offshore and onshore conditions. Designer Ken Winner has spent years developing these characteristics within the kite, always striving for perfection. The kite&#39;s weight has been optimized to increase performance and the kite reacts instantly to input from the bar. The result is a kite that feels like an extension of your body on the wave. The wind range is huge with lots of low-end power, allowing you to ride a smaller kite, while at the top end, the kite still offers lots of control. If you want to dominate the waves with total confidence and rule skies, the Neo is the kite for you; tune it to your riding style, initiate the launch sequence, and head straight to the top step of any podium!</description>

The HA1525&#8217;s impressive speed and glide performance caters perfectly to advanced riders of all weights looking to maximise downwinders and flatwater pumping.&#160; Effortless Glide In our quest to create an inspiring range of High Aspect foils, we honed a design that emphasizes glide and speed.

<title>Quickblade Stingray SUP 72 Adjustable All Carbon</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=10227</link>
<g:price>599.0000</g:price>
<description>
The Stingray is a revolutionary new shape that will change the paddling world as we know it. The blade is only 10 inches long (25cm) which is half the length of most traditional blades, the reduced blade length reduces the catch and exit time by 100% as it takes half the time. The reduced blade length allows the center of area of the blade to be just 3.5&quot; from the tip of the blade giving it a more distinct snappy catch and release. This blade has a thin foiled shape that at 12 degree angle to the shaft is designed to have some &quot;winged&quot; effect as you drive it into the water making the blade literally want to go forward as you make the catch giving you extra length on the power phase of the stroke. What is unique about this thin foiled shape is that it performs a similar effect in reverse as the blade starts to exit from the water it wants to thrust forward slightly and efficiently all of the way to the exit. To maximize the &quot;winged&quot; foil effect of the blade, we developed a special unique all carbon shaft that is tapered on both ends, providing minimal drag below the pulling hand and having a little more flex at the top hand by the handle, while having a slight oval shape where you hold it with the bottom hand. We created a very comfortable hollow carbon palm grip that comes standard on the Stingray, or you can custom request our carbon T-handle if you prefer. We believe based on Initial testing of the Stingray that it is so efficient it has increased boat traveling speeds by 1-2%.</description>

Even if you&#8217;re not a pro, this paddle will make you feel like one. The Hybrid Carbon-Glass blade allows the four phases of the stroke come to life. The carbon glass shaft makes it ultra lightweight. The ergonomic, molded grip is more function than form, making it easy on the hands.&#160; Inside the handle is the lever lock grip that allow to adjust the paddle length.&#160;&#160;&#160;The paddle features a 10 degree angled blade and weighs approximately 20 oz (depending on blade size and configuration).</description>

Description If you are a female kiteboarder, you will know the importance of having the right equipment; you wouldn&#8217;t wear a men&#8217;s wetsuit or harness, so why would you ride a board designed for the guys. The Soleil has been in the line-up at Duotone for so long now it&#8217;s hard to remember what life was like without it. Designed by women for women, it caters to the smaller frame and makes it easier to perform at your very best.

The solid construction ensures consistent flex throughout the board&#39;s length and has been tailored for your weight to allow the best pop while also offering a smooth ride. The Carbon Beam keeps the board light, making it easier to jump and spin, but it also helps to keep the ride responsive and engaging. Space Flex Tips make rotations easy and keep the weight low. So, if you are part of the growing army of female kiteboarders out there, get yourself the best board available to improve your riding; get onboard the 2023 Soleil!</description>

Great for teaching first time wingsurfers and exploring your local waterways. Using wind power you will propel yourself across the water at far higher speeds, while expending less energy than traditional paddling. If you do decide to use your board for standard paddling the keel is easily removable, while the streamlines stick-on fin-box remains attached the bottom of your board. Jump into the sport of wingsurfing now, using the SUP board you already own! &#160;</description>

<g:price>1887.0000</g:price>
<description>
Description Introducing the redesigned Rebel SLS for 2024, a true icon that continues to push boundaries and redefine the riding experience for a new generation of riders. This year, the design team focused on the wing tips to improve the handling and turning speed. In addition, the canopy tension was also optimised to improve the gust handling and enable the kite to keep its shape no matter the wind strength. The combination of Penta TX and Trinity TX creates a remarkably rigid kite that maintains its shape even in challenging gusty conditions, providing consistent and smooth power delivery. The addition of Flex Struts allows the tips to twist, resulting in intuitive handling and exceptionally dynamic steering. While the Rebel SLS offers impressive power, it also provides unparalleled control. With its instantaneous depower, you can confidently navigate strong conditions and achieve extraordinary heights during big air jumps. The explosive take-off and vertical boost of the kite will propel you to new levels, while the extended hangtime will make you feel as if you&#39;re floating in the air, experiencing longer flight times with every jump. Even in light winds, the Rebel SLS remains highly capable, delivering ample low-end power through quick upstrokes, thanks to its lighter weight. This reduced weight also improves drift, allowing you to swing under the kite during landings and easily recover it. The Rebel SLS is a perfect choice for freeride enthusiasts and those seeking massive jumps with long hangtimes. Light up the height scores at your local spot and go extra-large with the new Rebel SLS.&#160;</description>

Product Information Duotone Jaime 2023 Kiteboard Innovative big air and freestyle kiteboard from Duotone The&#160;Duotone Jaime 2023&#160;has been in revolution for over 15 years and of course it will be back in the Duotone twintip line in 2023. Anyone who has ever ridden the Jaime knows that you are sold after the first few meters. It is the perfect choice for freestyle, freeride and big air as it rides so smoothly in all conditions. With the perfect amount of flex and pop you can do whatever you want with the Jaime, from board off flips to powered handle passes, the Jaime does it all! For 2023, Duotone has given the Jaime some amazing upgrades to further increase its performance. This year the Duotone Jaime 2023 has been upgraded with a new double rocker line, a small bend in the rail of the twintip that brings a huge amount of grip. Thanks to this large amount of grip, the kiteboard offers an impressive amount of pop and it is even easier to push off for a jump. The new innovative construction of the fins ensures that the fins are screwed to the kiteboard at an angle, so that you ride even faster upwind and have even more grip. Keeping your edge in 40 knots has never been easier! The Duotone jaime 2023 is equipped with a good dose of torsional stiffness and a Carbon Web, which makes the kiteboard feel super lively underfoot and brings a playful ride regardless of the conditions. Compared to the Duotone Jaime SLS 2023, the normal Jaime 2023 is a bit more forgiving and the Jaime offers a little more comfort. Thanks to the medium flex, the kiteboard rides through chop without effort and brings a very comfortable ride. The precisely tuned materials provide control, power and comfort in just the right way at all times. At the bottom of the Jaime you will find a Double Diffuser Bottom that breaks the water surface and surprises you with amazing feedback and vibrancy underfoot. The tips are special absorption flex tips, which make the ride even more comfortable and forgiving with a big dose of performance potential. The kiteboard&#39;s rail is designed to ride upwind without effort, in combination with Duotone&#39;s innovative fins you can&#39;t help but fly upwind like a rocket! Riders of the Duotone Jaime 2023 are rewarded with effortless loading for a jump, an impressive take-off and very soft landings, in short, the perfect tool for breaking hight records! Are you a progressive rider who is also looking for comfort in a kiteboard, then the Duotone Jaime 2023 is the ideal kiteboard for you! &#160; Specifications Duotone Jaime 2023 Big air/freestyle New angled fins New Double Rocker Line New Torsion FLex Cap Carbon Web Absorption flex tips Double Diffuser Bottom Medium Flex Sporty and forgiving ride</description>

Highly responsive, intuitive and capable of super drift, enjoy the easy to fly nature of the kite and its impeccable handling in all conditions! The BANDIT S3 improves riders surfing skills in no time! SIZE (m2) 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 WIND RANGE (knts) 30+ 25+ 23+ 20+ 16 &gt; 28 14 &gt; 25 12 &gt; 22 10 &gt; 20 Absolute control at all time Intuitive traction Amazing turning response when sheeted out Instant depower to forget about your kite when surfing Lighter and even more precise New size available: 11 m2 The true partner to the surfboard rider, the BANDIT S3 follows your every move in all control. You can manage the power at any time. The kite never surges in power if you throw the kite in the window, it simply allows you to kite smoothly in the right position and ride by feel. It provides a more subtle ride as well as a constant connection with your board. You are not being pulled away, nor are your trajectories being disturbed. Its forgiving nature make the BANDIT sits and wait for you next input. The BANDIT S3 offers fingertip control at all states of trim thanks to its incredibly balanced bar feel which is really comfortable on your arms. Turning response when sheeted out has been increased, giving you more control over the kite&#8217;s position almost at will. The kite&#8217;s handling is precise and provides a more subtle ride as well as a constant connection with your board. You are not being pulled away, nor are your trajectories being disturbed. Power delivery is clean, and although quick, very intuitive in feel to adapt to. Drifting is on point, your lines go a bit of slack and the BANDIT S3 only takes a second to retention and be ready for your next input, allowing you to keep your kite engaged at all time when surfing. The leading edge has a new diameter, offering more control. The new double vertical panel around the trailing edge offer a sleek profile for the most stable flight. Enjoy the unique flowing nature of the BANDIT S3 which will allow you to draw lines and get some airs in total control. DELTA C-SHAPE DELTA C-SHAPE technology design offers unmatched stability and steering response when fully de-powered, with the possibility of connecting the front lines higher on the leading edge of the kite. REACTOR VALVE Our fast inflation &amp; deflation valve. AUTO RELAUNCH Once the kite is sitting with the leading edge flat on the water, its C-Shape associated with the Delta Pivot allows the kite to automatically roll over onto one wing tip. FORCE FRAME Kites with extended de-power ranges sustain more pressure across the canopy as they experience an increased frequency of use over a wider wind range. TECHNOFORCE TECHNOFORCE&#8482; of TEIJIN is a high density Polyester fabric with a tear stopping structure using thin and high tension yarn. BACK LINE TUNING How to adjust the settings? SHEETED IN The back line is released and the forces go through the front connector. The bar pressure increases and the maneuvrability is less direct. It offers a very progressive bar with a feeling of a sheeted out back connector while we sheet in, therefore the pressure increases progressively. SHEETED OUT The kite tilts and the back line stiffens. The tensions move to the trailing edge which has several effects: - less flapping - better start - maneuvrability with less pressure. HIGH TENSION TUNING When the kite is sheeted out with the upper knot tuning (1): -kite&#8217;s maneuvrability increases -bar pressure reduces LOW TENSION TUNING When the kite is sheeted in with the lower knot tuning (2): - kite&#8217;s maneuvrability reduces - bar pressure increases FLAT SEWING&#160; Stronger assembly of the panels: they are now glued and sewn together to make the canopy more rip resistant. STREAMLINED LEADING EDGE END TIPS The leading edge tips benefit from a reduced diameter, they are streamlined to lower the drag and equipped with a strap to avoid bridle tangling VERTICAL STRUT CUT The kite&#39;s struts are designed with a vertical cut in order to optimize the strength / diameter ratio. F-ONE PULLEY Pulley structure is extremely resistant. Bridle is integrated in the lower part of the pulley, working in its axis and not sideways. Pulleys can be removed independently from the bridle, you can change the bridle and keep the pulley or vice versa. KEVLAR&#174; REINFORCEMENT ON LEADING EDGE&#160; Most seams on the leading edge are protected with an abrasion-resistant Kevlar&#174; fabric to prevent the seams from deteriorating when the kite&#39;s profile is subjected to aggressive ground friction ONE PUMP COLLAR VALVE Easier to remove and put back. Convenient for bladder replacement. TEIJIN 130G DACRON RIPSTOP We have built our kites for 20 years in the most state-of-the-art cloth from Teijin&#8217;s factory in Japan. They have developed the best technologies and quality material for our kites over the years. Teijin has worked on a few major developments with the double Ripstop on the canopy cloth and durability treatments. The kite industry was lacking choice of cloth density. We could build kites with a 52 gr per square meter for the canopy and about 160 gr for the leading edge, strut and reinforcements. Having only two choices was not easy because on some parts the 52 gr was too light and the 160 gr too heavy. After developments and tests with Teijin we can now use a new Dacron 130 gr double Ripstop on our 2020 kites. By using that new 130 gr cloth, we have saved weight while keeping an excellent strength. The new BANDIT 2021 is more reactive and of course feels lighter, which is particularly important for the bigger sizes, in the light wind or for the turning speed during kiteloops.</description>

***BACK IN STOCK 3rd week of DEC*** &#160; Description No compromise efficiency! A complete redesign of our Downwinder comes in three sleek and lightweight shapes to get up on the foil easily and fly for miles! One of the first boards the Spencer brothers Finn and Jeffrey worked on after joining Team Duotone was the redesign of the Downwinder shapes. Resulting in sleek, fast and narrow designs, with efficient glide that accelerates with just a few paddle&#160;strokes on the smallest bump. For the 2024 collection we&#8217;re offering four dedicated&#160;from the small 6&#39;4&quot; x 19&#8221; and 6&#39;10&quot; x 20&#8221; to the mid-sized 7&#39;2&quot; x 21&quot; and the stable and easy 7&#39;8&quot; x 22.5&#8221;, in volumes of 85, 95, 115 and 135l. With a low rocker, stretched outline and clean bottom contours, the boards are incredibly easy to bring up to take-off speed. Once in motion, the slim pin tails with pronounced rail bevels on the larger models are easy to push into the water to pump your board and foil out for take-off. The rounded rails up in the nose area are less prone to catch and to steer the board in unwanted directions, making take-off and touchdowns forgiving and neutral, so you can focus on the bumps instead of your board. Due to the incredible glide and quick acceleration the Downwinder is also a real weapon for light wind Wing Foiling! Built in lightweight full carbon construction, these boards have to be handled with care, but since the weight of the board is essential for paddle-up performance, we went for a no-compromise technology for the 2024 Downwinders.</description>

<title>2024 North Mode PRO Wing</title>

<g:price>1249.0000</g:price>

From North For high-speed performance, efficiency is key. We&#8217;ve engineered Mode, our high-speed performance wing, with high tensile strength N-Weave 45 X-ply reinforced woven fibre airframe and Matrix N-HTRS canopy for the most efficient power delivery on the market. Developing these new material technologies has allowed us to create a stiffer, lighter and more durable wing without geometric compromise (and without the high-performance price tag). N-Weave 45 reduces structural deflection and transfers wind energy into greater forward speed, explosive boost and hangtime for freestyle tricks. We&#8217;ve specifically designed our new low-stretch, low-deflection Matrix N-HTRS high-tenacity canopy material to manage the added tension of the N-Weave 45 airframe, further increasing the wind range, and holding its shape in all conditions. The Mode has a fast, VMG-optimized design, which lets you sail closer to the wind, on higher upwind angles, and reduces your need to tack or gybe. We designed the Mode primarily for high-speed performance, but the stiffer airframe also translates into unprecedented loft for higher jumps and forward momentum on landings. With incredible high-end stability, the 3.5 to 4.8m are ideal for use in stronger winds, while the 5.5m and 6.8m are optimised for greater power in lighter air. The wing has a balanced lower aspect ratio with rounded wingtips to reduce tip strike, and the new panel layout delivers wingtip stability and increased tension under load. Featuring Carbon?GripLock?rigid micro-trim?control handles for immediate response, and gybe-friendly window positioning. Features Improved structural integrity Highly efficient power delivery VMG optimised design Freestyle and Freeride Performance High end stability and impressive wind range New panel layout Compact outline with reduced wingspan Connected dual inflation valves Gybe-friendly window positioning Materials N-Weave45 Airframe Matrix Canopy Carbon GripLock Handles Package Includes Wing Wrist Leash Bag Repair Kit</description>

Learn Wing Foiling in no time with the Sky Start &#8211; the easiest possible entry into the exciting world of flying above the water! Based on the Sky Wing Soft Top and the feedback of our unmatched network of schools and centers, we&#8217;ve updated the concept of the perfect learner board and designed the Sky Start. With a length of 6&#8217;7&#8221;, 31 inches of width and a volume of 155l, the completely new outline of the Sky Start offers a very stable and safe platform for those learning the basic steps from crawling onto the board to finding the right stance and their first take-off. For those riders being able to safely fly along and learning first gybes and tacks, the Sky Start is still compact enough for a great flying sensation to have fun and progress. Covered entirely in soft and gentle EVA pad around the rails and the full deck, the Sky Start makes the entry into Wing Foiling as comfortable and user friendly as you possibly imagine!&#160;</description>

Experience the stoke and freedom of downwinders with F-ONE&#8217;s ROCKET SUP DW PRO board. Thanks to its optimized sleek design and ultra-light bamboo construction, get up on your foil faster than ever and experience the pure bliss of flying above the swell for hours on end. &#8226; Incredibly efficient and fast take-offs &#8226; Superb stability at all times &#8226; Immense glide and speed &#8226; Controlled front/back leg balance &#8226; Control and maneuverability even at high speeds The ROCKET SUP DW PRO was designed to minimize drag and to promote early and efficient take-offs in any conditions, whether it&#8217;s flat waters or big open ocean bumps. This board benefits from the best compromise between length, width and volume so as to remain accessible to the highest number of riders. Its long and narrow shape brings fantastic glide and high speed for paddle starts, while its boxy rails lead to great stability. With the ROCKET SUP DW PRO, paddle efficiently and get onto foil easily and unbelievably fast all while benefitting from great stability. Volume is distributed to keep the rider&#8217;s paddling position very close to the flying position and to minimize changes in the feet and stance. The balance between the front and back leg is excellent, allowing you to put just the right amount of power on the front leg before and during the take-off phase without the board ever nose diving. The nose is streamlined and keeps enough volume and buoyancy for aggressive paddling and take-off, further helping to get some momentum for easy starts when in the bumps. The tail is pinched in to improve water flow and reduce the drag. The lower tail volume also helps rocking and pumping the board for take-off. The rails have been optimized for more comfort during take-offs and in the air. The bevel on the lower rail makes the board easier to handle during touchdowns and reduces friction at speed. The hard chines of the bevel improve water separation, thus helping during take-off and reducing deceleration on touchdowns. A third chine at the back provides extra stability and improves water separation at the tail as well. Finally, the flat hull noticeably features a small step which brings air onto the rear part of the hull. This reduces friction and once again helps during take-off. Once up on the foil, the board is designed to be super stable. The subtle, recessed cockpit- like deck lowers your center of gravity and brings you closer to the foil, leading to excellent control of the board in-flight. The ROCKET SUP DW PRO benefits from the same shape as its CARBON counterpart, but features an ultra-light Bamboo Deck Construction. Using a layer of bamboo only on the deck, this construction has been optimized to guarantee the board is as light as possible, all while ensuring strength and durability as well. The feeling of the foil is super direct, and control is absolute throughout the entire downwind, even at high speeds. Naturally, the ROCKET SUP DW PRO is slightly less stiff than its CARBON counterpart, particularly when pumping, but the performance potential on the water is virtually the same as both boards have the same shape and program. With its outstanding and easy take-off abilities, this board will satisfy all riders and make downwind further accessible to those who always wanted to try. It is also incredible with a wing in lighter winds, and it can surf really well, even in very small waves. Take off far outside on non-breaking waves and make the most of the board&#8217;s maneuverability and direct feeling to surf until the shore break. It is available in three different widths: 18&#8221; (80.5L &#8211; 110L), 19&#8221; (86L &#8211; 110L) and 20&#8221; (98L &#8211; 130L). This makes for a total of 15 different sizes to choose from depending on the needed volume and length, as well as the skill level of each rider. All boards are equipped with a full pad and the Twin-Tracks system for foil compatibility. These Twin-Tracks are positioned further forward to reflect the new balance of the board and again to facilitate take-off, pumping and flying behavior. The perfect balance between stability, accessibility, glide and easy starts, the ROCKET SUP DW PRO will undoubtedly get you hooked on downwinds.</description>

Mystic 2022 Gem Women&#39;s Harness The Gem has the same roven composite bionic core frame as the Majestic, but with a specialized female shaped form for women to shred in. With soft neoprene edges and fix foam, the harness will give you all the comfort which makes it great for wave-riding. The Gem has a smart battle 2.0 system with flexvoers and a key pocket 2.0 Features Bionic Core Frame Roven Composite: The Bionic Core Frame is stiff in the horizontal direction, but it is still able to twist and follow the movement of your body. The Roven composite has an 8/10 score on the stiffness index, which gives you the comfortable stiffness to throw big kite loops, yet its 7/10 torsion flex makes it flexible enough for sharp bottom turns. Bionic Core Frame: The Bionic Core Frame is stiff in the horizontal direction, but is still able to twist and follow your body. The carbon composite enhances the stiffness for the most extreme conditions. Fix Foam: This foam molded to adjust perfectly to your lower body and give maximum comfort while riding. Soft neoprene edges: Soft neoprene prevents rash while riding on bare asking against the edges of the harness, and also created a closer more comfortable fit. ?Flexcovers with integrated safety knife pocket: ?The flexcover is designed to store your excessive webbing, which would otherwise flap about during your session. Behind the cover there is a hidden knife pocket to get you out of any gnarly situation. Suitable for Stealth bar &amp; Ace bar</description>

<title>2022 ION Harness Kite Seat Sonar</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=9500</link>
<g:price>199.9900</g:price>
<description>
The Sonar is performance-oriented and especially tailored towards the needs of foiling/race-foiling. Characteristically, it features a low profile which generates a low center of load transmission. The partly Curv construction improves force distribution and back support. Ergonomic leg straps, inspired by the technology of climbing harnesses, allow for freedom of movement without pressure points. ION&#39;s sleek and lightweight Spectre Bar (including kite hook) amps up the direct feeling even further. To prevent the spreader bar from riding up, it comes with the Downforce_Loop, which helps to keep the low hook position. Including Kite_Knife Multitool 2.0 and HPL_Slider.</description>

<g:price>99.9900</g:price>
<description>
We&#8217;ve cracked the performance code with our Quantum line of wetsuits, ending the era in which high performance and flexibility equate to a compromise in durability. Our game-changing approach starts with quality materials like limestone-based neoprene and specially developed linings with stretch zones in high-movement areas. The upper-body panels of this cool-water, long-sleeved shorty are internally reinforced with our flexible THERMO insulation to prevent windchill in exposed areas. The seams of the Quantum Chest-Zip Long-Sleeved Shorty 2/2MM F/L suit are flatlock stitched for extra strength, and the &#8220;easy-in&#8221; chest-zip design prevents water from flushing through the soft-feel, compression-cut collar. The Quantum will change your expectation of what a wetsuit can be.</description>

INSPIRED BY SEAN SILVEIRA Once Sean Silveira hit the scene, it didn&#8217;t take very long to realize he would deserve a board of his own.

<g:price>951.2000</g:price>
<description>
DESIGNED BY JOHN AKERMAN Supporting aggressive skim style riding, the Phase Five MVP Wakesurfer harnesses unique features not found anywhere else in our lineup. First you will notice a full decked Techno Traction V2 EVA grip pad with nose kick tail support for superior foot control. John&#8217;s idea for a kick tail in the nose was to gain more leverage to execute tricks while riding revert. The MVP is the only board with our RidgeGrip technology, a unique rail design inspired by his direct feedback. RidgeGrip stiffens the board and offers a pronounced spot to grab when executing tricks above the lip. The moon tail design and V-Spline bottom contours deliver maximum speed and handling. The MVP LTD boasts our brand new lightweight, insanely fresh looking ChromaCarbon construction and built with a single fin setup loaded with our 1&#8221; Skim Fin.</description>

<g:price>820.0000</g:price>
<description>
REFINED PROVEN SHAPE Drew Danielo wanted more pop and speed, and that is exactly what we created with the Phase Five Diamond Turbo Wakesurfer. We enhanced the original Diamond tail shape with a wider, more boxed out design. This upgraded design feature delivers experienced riders the opportunity to go big. The Turbo tail design is also the solution for large riders who need more push and surfers using smaller, less powerful waves. The Diamond Turbo is built using our unique Carbon Innegra Vertical (CI-V) weave material for ultimate strength. We configured the Diamond Turbo with a three fin setup installed with our 2&#8221; Skim Fin in the center accompanied by 1&#8221; Fakie Skim fins on the outside.</description>

The Luv is built with our eye-catching Carbon Innegra Vertical (CI-V) weave material, and a single fin setup loaded with our 1&#8221; Skim Fin. This is tough LUV! &#160;</description>

The exaggerated nose rocker in the tip makes the board extremely forgiving, helping to prevent nose dives, and the thruster fin configuration is customizable. Run just one, two, or all three fins for maximum grip. This skim-style cruiser that delivers the best of all worlds from beginner to expert levels. The Coaster rides fast and free&#8212;excellent for teaching newbies, carving hard, and integrating skim/ skate-style maneuvers into your bag of tricks.

Built in premium XR Construction, this board is feather-light for that super responsive feel you crave.

Description Park / Press / Youth&#160; The Space Grom is one of the highest performance boards for young riders ever made. Built with our lively Atomic Wood Core and a softer flex that lightweight riders are able to manipulate, so they can ride with the same style and agility (if not more) than their elder mentors.&#160; Package Includes: 2024 Space Grom Wakeboard, 75 x 6&quot; (1.9 x 15.2 cm) Wake Fins (4)&#160; The future of wakeboarding is bright, and trending younger and younger each season! For this reason we&#39;ve built Space Grom (formerly super grom) to be the highest performance board for groms ever made! The Space Grom is built with our lively Atomic Wood Core and a softer flex that lightweight riders are able to manipulate, so they can ride with the same style and agility (if not more) than their elder mentors. We wanted every young rider to have access to the same great high-performance product as their shred mentors. The Space Grom is extremely durable and built to keep up with that endless supply of energy oozing out of the frothy young rippers. The soft flex allows them to ride like a pro regardless of their age or size.&#160; Atomic Wood Core&#160; Vertically laminated wood core construction is what gives Slingshot boards their signature flex performance. It&#39;s lightweight and durable, delivering superior pop, rebound, and that overall magical feeling in the park.&#160; Single-Shot Fusion Sidewalls&#160; Our innovative manufacturing process produces unrivaled dampening and durability by infusing the rail into the core of the board with a single shot, eliminating the need for fasteners or staples.&#160; Carbon Bedrock Inserts&#160; Light, flexible, and super strong, our Carbon Bedrock Inserts reduce overall board weight, increase pull strength, and allow for a more consistent flex under foot.&#160; Ballistic Base&#160; With .7mm&#39;s of bulletproof protection between your board and the surfaces you&#39;re sliding across, this base layer is ready for battle. Put to the test daily by some of the most daring park riders in the game.&#160; Continuous Rocker Profile&#160; This continuous curve equates to faster board speed on the water, allowing you to ride for longer periods of time with less arm fatigue and delivering an exciting, fast, and fun feel.</description>

<title>Duotone Wing Set Aero Carve 2.0 SLS</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=10189</link>
<g:price>729.0000</g:price>
<description>
Description Building on the success of our latest range of Carve wings, the design goal of the Carve 2.0 was to push the performance of these mid aspect wings even further. Our team riders wanted more glide, more speed and less drag, all whilst increasing the manoeuvrability and maintaining our trademark control at high speed. We decided to start from a blank page and pretty much changed all the design parameters of the wing: higher aspect ratio, new outline and curvature, new profiles and twist along the wing. Not only that but each individual size has been tuned independently to best fit its intended use. The bigger 1430 for example has the lowest aspect ratio and thinnest profile, to maximise maneuvrability and reduce the drag, on the opposite side, our 850 as the highest aspect ratio and thickest profile, to improve the lift and delay the stall on such a small wing. The Carve 2.0 is the go-to wing if you want to tackle &#8220;real waves&#8221;. What it sacrifices in terms of glide compared to the Free or the Glide, it makes up with higher top end speed and way more manoeuvrability on the wave face. The Carve 2.0 is also the preferred choice of our freestyle team competing on the world tour. These wings allow them to load up for their jumps with more speed which translates into a more explosive pop. The medium aspect ratio also means that the hard landings are a lot less stressful for the rest of their gear. This same medium aspect ratio is also what makes the Carve 2.0 wings a great choice for Kite Foiling. Riders can lean on their mast more aggressively without the wing tips coming out of the water. If you are an intermediate to advanced rider looking at the one wing that can do it all, from Wing Foiling in big waves to high-speed runs on the Kite Foil, the Carve 2.0 is the answer! &#160; Stabilizer P Our latest range of stabilizers, specially designed to complement our Carve 2.0 and Glide ranges. The P series stands for performance! We increased the aspect ratio of the stabilizers so that they would produce more lift whilst being smaller in surface area. Doing so helped us decreasing the drag and increasing the maneuvrability without loosing that high speed control which our foils are famous for. The P Stabilizers are available in four sizes, 165/180/200/220. Each of them slightly tweaked to work perfectly with our new front wings. These new stabs are almost completely flat and have lost the little winglets which can be found on our other range: the C Stabilizers. By making these changes we were able to loosen the feel in the turns, which gives an exciting flavour to our new front wings. Take full advantage of our brand new thin shims and tweak the angle of attack of your stabilizer by +/- 0.3 degrees increments, to suit your particular riding style, or the conditions on a given day.</description>

Description The Aero Free is our jack of all trades. Our three new bigger sizes 1500, 1750 and 2000 are the perfect wings for beginner and intermediate riders. Their stable flight, early lift and good top speed make them the ideal wings to progress quickly. The three smaller sizes 800, 1000 and 1250 have been on the market for a year already and have established themselves as great performance allrounders. The Aero Free range sits right in the middle of our new Glide and Carve 2.0 ranges when it comes to its glide capability and manoeuvrability &#8211; coming in a slightly higher aspect ratio than our new Carve 2.0 but with a different profile and outline, targeted more for a great mix of manoeuvrability, glide, pumping and overall ease of use. The Aero Free covers all disciplines, from Wing, Prone, SUP and Windsurf Foiling. The name gives it away, this wing isn&#8217;t bound to a specific discipline, it feels at home in any water state and with every rider &#8211; whether you&#8217;re into Freeride, Freestyle, Freerace, Surf or Downwind. Coming in an aspect ratio between 6.0 for the bigger 2000 to 7.3 for the small 800cm2, these front wings will be the ones to look at, from learning the basics all the way to stepping down in size and speeding up your foiling game in a variety of conditions, from flatwater cruising to jumps, surf and downwinders. Featuring a playful outline and low drag profile that feels exciting and fast, yet still brings a lot of ease and control. There&#8217;s no conditions this wing feels out of place! &#160; Stabilizer C &#160; Our range of Stabilizer C have been working flawlessly in combination with all our front wings for the last few years. They are what one could call a &#8220;traditional&#8221; approach, medium aspect ratio, flat in the center and going into a subtle winglet towards the wingtip. A well tested and proven design which works great with our Aero Free SLS and Aero Lift SLS front wings. The C-Series stands for control. They are all about keeping the rider on its trajectory and keeping the pitch in check. Even though they are great at maintaining a stable flight, they are still loose enough to allow for smooth turns and return great feedback in the waves. Take full advantage of our brand new thin shims and tweak the angle of attack of your stabilizer by +/- 0.3 degrees increments, to suit your particular riding style or the conditions on a given day.</description>

Description Our Aero Lift wing is designed for the easiest access to the sensation of flying above the water with a foil - regardless of previous watersports experience, or your size or weight. A must have wing for schools as well as any beginner riders wanting to make their progression as easy as possible. Passive take-offs and stable flights are the qualities we had in mind when designing the Aero Lift 2400, our ultimate flight guarantee for every entry level rider. With 110cm of span, a wider chord and a profile with a higher lift, the wing takes off at lowest speeds and just keeps flying through wind holes and all your early maneuvres. Incredible stability guarantees a quick learning curve, yet the impressive speed and glide for a wing of that size will let you enjoy the Aero Lift for much longer than just the first few sessions. It&#8217;s a wing you&#8217;ll keep in your quiver for the light days and for anyone else you&#8217;re going to hook up with your new passion. The wing tips are rounded, designed with safety in mind. The Aero Lift 2400 is designed with our 300cm back wing and the wings are best matched with our 74/76cm fuselages for the ultimate lift and flying stability. &#160; Stabilizer C Our range of Stabilizer C have been working flawlessly in combination with all our front wings for the last few years. They are what one could call a &#8220;traditional&#8221; approach, medium aspect ratio, flat in the center and going into a subtle winglet towards the wingtip.

<description>
The Quick Release Recoil Wrist leash is for riders that want to keep everything up high. The one-handed, comfortable, durable wrist closure is also equipped with a quick release for emergency situations. Staying connected to your wing is important&#8212;no one is going to argue that! But how and where you connect your wing leash to your body is always a debate. The coiled urethane cord keeps everything tidy and high when riding, as well as more manageable when getting on the board. In addition, if you use a harness while winging, the on-wrist connection will limit accidental hooking in of your leash. Features 7mm polyurethane cord Coiled quick-release cord construction Easy one-handed wrist cuff operation Neoprene-covered stainless-steel swivels Suggested use: Winging wing leash</description>

<description>
The freestyle allrounder FREESTYLE+ | WAVE | FREERIDE No limits. That&#8217;s what you get with the new Choice 4. Kickers. Lagoon. Boots. Or Straps. We build the Cartan carbon powered Choice 4 to do it all. And now with Katana tips, beveled deck, and tucked under bottom rails, you&#8217;ll be killin&#8217; it everywhere.&#160; What&#8217;s new? Unique top and bottom rails that improve riding comfort and performance. We beveled the top deck between the footpads by approximately 2mm in thickness to improve flex. The bottom edge receives a new 60/40 tucked-under rail between the pads that transitions into a flat box rail at the tips. Water flow improves, navigating chop is more comfortable, and the tips bite better than ever. It&#8217;s harder to manufacture, but we&#8217;re sure you&#8217;ll appreciate our attention to detail. Maybe you&#8217;re not a wakestyler, but you could be one day. And perhaps you&#8217;re not a big air expert yet, but you&#8217;re on your way. So, keep your options open with the Choice 4 &#8211; a limitless twintip. &#160; Sizes 133x40 | 135x41 | 137x41,5 | 139x42 | 141x42,5 | 144x43,5 &#160; Delivery Choice 4, grab handle, G10 Pro Fins (42mm), V4A-Screws. &#160; Features: NEW! KATANA CHANNELS: More bite. Better pop. NEW! BEVELED DECK: Less weight. Added stiffness. NEW! TRIPLE EDGE DESIGN: More comfortable in chop.&#160; CARTAN&#174;CARBON: Proprietary 30&#176; biaxial carbon fiber that optimizes board torsion and dynamic longitudinal flex. 3D WOOD CORE: Powered by a superlight CNC milled Paulownia wood core. VARIO RAILS: Precise flex with progressive edge thicknesses. MULTI-CHANNELS: Superior grip and speed with deep, full-length channels. V-SHAPED KEEL: Amazingly smooth ride even in nasty chop. And butter soft landings. PRO ROCKER: Custom board flex and curvature. BOOT TOUGH INSERTS: Plywood Block Inserts - Heavily reinforced boot inserts.</description>

<g:price>1749.0000</g:price>
<description>
Details A brand-new board in the Duotone line-up, the Voyage is a board that many of you have been asking for and finally, after years of testing and perfecting the shape and design, the first split board in the range has arrived! Many split boards struggle with two main issues, flex, and the physical act of putting it together. The Voyage overcomes these by using an M-Spine connection that interweaves the two halves of the board, so they act as one when connected. You only need two pins to put the board together (no complicated screws or bolts you can lose in the sand), and the pins are connected to the board, so you can&#8217;t lose them during the assembly process; the icing on the cake, and what makes the Voyage so unique is the design itself. Using the fantastic Select as a starting point, the board has incredible DNA embedded into it. The board is designed for freeride and big air, with a comfortable ride and easy flex characteristics. It&#39;s smooth through the chop and fantastic at boosting into the air. The tips have been tuned for flex and channels added to offer grip and a better ride when the ocean is choppy. Easy to assemble, engaging to ride, ideal for travel but most of all, incredible for freeride and big air, the Voyage is a split board like no other. Features IDEAL TRAVEL BOARD WITH SPACE AT A PREMIUM ON SO MANY FLIGHTS THESE DAYS, THE VOYAGE CAN BE SPLIT IN HALF BY SIMPLY REMOVING TWO PINS, SAVING YOU SPACE AND MONEY WHEN YOU TRAVEL. M-SPINE THE M-SPINE CONNECTION IS INCREDIBLY SECURE AND DURABLE; IT ALSO HELPS WITH THE FLEX THROUGHOUT THE BOARD AND MAKES THE VOYAGE EXTREMELY RESPONSIVE. SELECT OUTLINE THE VOYAGE HAS BEEN DESIGNED AROUND THE INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL SHAPE OF THE SELECT; THE PREMIUM FREERIDE BOARD IN THE RANGE. TIP CHANNELS THESE HELP THE BOARD TRACK IN CHOPPY CONDITIONS AND REDUCE SOME OF THE CHATTER AS YOU RIDE ACROSS THE WATER. SOFT TIPS THESE ABSORB THE CHOP AND LEAD TO A SMOOTH RIDE NO MATTER THE WATER STATE. LIGHT WOODCORE TO KEEP THE BOARD&#39;S WEIGHT DOWN, A LIGHT WOODCORE IS USED; THIS HAS EXCELLENT FLEX CHARACTERISTICS AND MAKES THE RIDE VERY COMFORTABLE.</description>

<g:price>1479.0000</g:price>
<description>
Waiting for wind? The all-new Loft Pro has the power to unlock borderline sessions, lift you up instantly in the lightest wind and keep you on the foil for longer.Its deep profile and ultra-stiff frame provide the most efficient power delivery per m2, carrying you through the lulls and converting the slightest puff into powerful forward momentum. Engineered to feel as light as possible, the 2024 Loft Pro is an evolution of the Nova Light Wind, featuring carbon handles and powered by a new N-Weave45 airframe for a faster, stiffer wing with more instant response. Reduced seams/segments in the leading edge also help to reduce weight, and a reduced LE diameter makes the wing lighter and more agile. Even with the smaller diameter, the airframe still exceeds the stiffness of its predecessor. The Loft Pro is very compact for a wing this size, with less span for reduced tip strike, and a deep profile. The Loft Pro has balanced load distribution and lift for easier gybes, tacks and low-speed transitions. Rigid GripLock micro-trim handles deliver a more immediate response. Its refined compact outline and rounded wingtips help reduce tip-strike, and the manageable span width is tailored to fit every rider. Go by height to choose just one Nova Light Wind size for your quiver, and end the wait for wind. INCLUDES: Wing, Wrist Wing Leash, Bag, Compression Strap, Repair Kit&#160; -: Super-efficient power delivery -: Stiffer N-Weave45 Airframe -: Rigid Carbon GripLock handles -: Rounded wingtips for reduced tip-strike -: Refined, weight-saving design -: Balanced load distribution &#160;</description>

The PRO also features an increased aspect ratio generating a more efficient wing, delivering more power in all conditions. &#160; It&#8217;s our most advanced wing yet.</description>

<title>Core Roamer Wing Foilboard</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=9880</link>
<g:price>1999.9500</g:price>
<description>
Born to fly, the Roamer wingboard line is designed to meet all the challenges of modern wingfoiling with its instant forward drive and stable feel. Sporty and responsive, yet also minimising the early complexities of learning to ride, the carefully tuned shape ensures the easiest handling whatever the weather or water surface. Even the smallest 55L Roamer provides a real sense of stability even at slow speed, meaning that water launches have never been easier. The double concave bottom shape ensures quick take-offs and is also forgiving on touchdowns. High-volume concave rails are sharply designed for easy release and quickly distribute water away from the centre of the board for a confidence inspiring centre of gravity. An extra grippy pad maximises the power of your stance while the slightly angled deck and higher front foot position further optimises the influence you have with your foot pressures to help you plane faster. The tail kick optimises the angle-of-attack for more efficient pumping just before you take flight. To leverage extra power in footstraps there are inserts in the deck allowing you to choose between two straight positions for your back foot and six offset angled options for your front foot. The stiff carbon sandwich construction provides a direct feel and long lasting fun even for the most ambitious riders. The EPS core is extremely lightweight and covered with a robust carbon PVC shell, protecting against pressure points and preventing water ingress. Features FOIL ROCKER - Volume distribution within the board is carefully designed to ensure your riding balance is the main focus of performance. The slight rockerline in the deck, in combination with the high-volume concave rails, distribute water away from the center of the board for a greater sense of control to quickly inspire higher levels of confidence. OUTLINES - The double concave bottom shape ensures quick take-offs and is also forgiving on touchdowns. The rails are sharply designed for easy release to help in critical situations; for smoother boardstarts, when the board catches a steep piece of chop while you&#8217;re riding, or when leaning hard over during more aggressive turns. DECK - The slightly angled deck and higher front foot position further optimizes the influence you have with your foot pressures to help you plane faster. The tail kick&#8217;s increased angle-of-attack allows for more efficient pumping just before you take flight. CONSTRUCTION - The stiff carbon sandwich construction provides a direct feel and long-lasting fun even for the most ambitious riders. The EPS core is extremely lightweight and covered with a robust carbon PVC shell, protecting against pressure points and preventing water ingress. PADS &amp; INSERTS - An extra grippy pad maximizes the power of your stance. To leverage extra power in footstraps there are inserts in the deck allowing you to choose between two straight positions for your back foot and six offset angled options for your front foot. To prevent the board bouncing back towards the rider after a fall the twin leash plugs have been positioned to the side of the board. Package Includes Board Foot Straps and Track Mounting Hardware Sold Separately</description>

Description The Sky Free SLS is our Freeride weapon on steroids! Built in our SLS construction and shaped for quick progression, this board won&#8217;t let you down! The Sky Free SLS is a very popular model amongst ambitious wingers in lighter wind conditions. Its early planing rocker and easy take-off combined with a balanced ride and compact feel found a huge amount of fans within the large group of intermediate level wing foilers and heavier riders of advanced level. For 2024 our design team implemented slight rail bevels, which not only give the rails more clearance in tight gybes, tacks or carves in small waves, the bottom contours also follow a more parallel outline through the mid-section improving the glide and making the pumping of the board out and up onto the foil even easier. The deck recess and high-volume nose offer great stability during starts, landings or when not in flight-mode. Our two Sky Free SLS models come in our Strong &#8211; Light &#8211; Superior Carbon PVC Sandwich construction with additional rail and heel reinforcements to not only guarantee earliest flight, but also safe and solid landings for those taking their riding to the next level.</description>

SKY FREE TE SIZES: 5&#39;3&quot; / 5&#39;5&quot; Our new Sky Free Team Edition was designed for riders looking for the easiest board to improve in wing foiling paired with the best technology, performance and weight out there! Our Sky Free TE is the evolution of our popular Sky Wing range &#8211; the bestselling wing boards on the market! With early planing rocker lines, sharp release edges and without unnecessary shape gimmicks &#8211; these boards embody pure function with a flowing outline allowing tight turns without catching the rail, yet having the width and glide to get you started and flying with ease. The deck recess and high-volume nose offer extra stability which allowed shaper Sky Solbach to shorten the length in the respective volumes vs. the 2022 Sky Wing models without sacrificing the ease of use these boards are famous for, resulting in a board that offers an even more compact and direct foiling sensation. Offered in two sizes in our uncompromised lightweight Carbon PVC Sandwich construction, there&#8217;s simply no board that gets you up and going earlier in the lightest of winds. &#160; &#160; SPECS BOARD VOLUME WIDTH LENGTH WEIGHT FITTINGS REC.

SKY STYLE TE SIZES: 4&#39;7&quot; / 4&#39;9&quot; / 4&#39;11&quot; / 5&#39;1&quot; The name says it all! These models are designed to evolve your style &#8211; whether in the air or in the surf, pushing your wing game has never been so easy! The Sky Style, available in four sizes from 55l to 85l, has been designed to maximize stability when starting and landing tricks, as well as improving turns, reactivity and take-offs for jumps. The higher rocker line of the Sky Style greatly improves turning response through increased leverage over the pitch of your foil, resulting in faster and more direct reactivity. The more &#8220;nose-up&#8221; riding style is ideal for starts and landings and improves the flying and turning behaviour of your foil when drawing lines in the surf. The deep deck recess with a high-volume nose section offers incredible stability for landings and creates a stable and balanced platform for sinking starts for riders using the Sky Style in a volume that doesn&#8217;t fully float their body weight. The higher nose recovers remarkably well from steep landings and makes it much easier to load up for jumps by providing more distance between the nose and the water to prevent catching. If you&#8217;re ready to step down in size and up your game in style &#8211; the Sky Style is your best chance to impress in your local break or lake. &#160; &#160; SPECS BOARD VOLUME WIDTH LENGTH WEIGHT FITTINGS REC.

<title>2023 North Charge Surfboard</title>

<g:price>779.3500</g:price>
<description>
Developed for surfing. Engineered for kitesurfing. Smooth and powerful down the line, turning hard in the pocket and releasing on-demand, the Charge is a high-performance surfboard. It is a fast, dedicated surf shape with loads of projection for a powerful vertical attack in&#160;larger waves.&#160;The Charge also excels at carving, driving upwind, onshore riding, and is versatile enough for aerial tricks. Our Carbon Innegra Futurelite construction maximises the board&#8217;s strength, without losing flex or responsiveness, while the DualShock EVA inserts increases its durability and protects from heel dents. Refined in 2023 for improved response, speed and drive, the new Charge delivers an even smoother, more powerful ride with a positive feel and more radical turns. Feedback from riders charging some of the world&#8217;s biggest waves led to us making very slight refinements to the shape to improve the handling at speed and drive through the turns. We&#39;ve moved the wide point of the board slightly forward, and we&#39;ve increased the concave under the front foot. We&#39;ve also reshaped the rounded surf rails to be lower and more refined, giving the board more grip when you&#8217;re carving the wave face. Also new for 2023 is the two-piece no-slip fine corduroy deck grip, with front and rear kicks for exceptional comfort and control.</description>

2023 DUOTONE WHIP SLS SURFBOARD The Whip SLS is an incredible small to medium wave and strapless freestyle machine. A generous nose rocker, high-performance rails and a &quot;wide bump-squash&quot; tail design make the Whip quick and agile when transitioning rail to rail. It is very reactive and can operate in a tight transition in small waves for radical turns. The Whip&#39;s compact shape is the ideal board for strapless freestyle pros and seasoned surfers. The Whip SLS is an extremely well-balanced board with incredible handling, but still provides explosive snap off the top with the ability to turn in a very tight radius on steep sections. If you want to perform the latest tricks and lay some serious turns in the critical part of the wave, the Whip SLS is the board for you! &#160; &#160; Whip SLS Features HIGH PERFORMANCE SMALL WAVE/FREESTYLE BOARD The unique shape of the Whip SLS makes it the perfect board for the rider who likes to throw down the latest tricks as much as they want to carve up the waves.&#160; &#160; SNAPPY TOP TURNS The compact shape enables you to turn incredibly tightly in the pocket; vertical top to bottom turns are the specialty of the Whip SLS.&#160; &#160; INCREDIBLE SPEED GENERATION The rocker line and channel on the board&#39;s base combine to offer incredible speed, both on the wave&#160;and when riding on the&#160;plate; this is great for linking turns, catching fast waves, and popping huge tricks.&#160; &#160; INNEGRA SHIELD The innegra shield completely wraps around the whole board; this provides unrivaled protection from everyday knocks and scrapes and keeps your board looking fresh.&#160; &#160; CORK SHOCK ABSORBER 2.0 Comfort for your feet, the Cork Shock Absorber 2.0 takes the pressure off your heels while providing perfect contact with the board to transfer your movements into the wave.&#160; &#160; CARBON BEAM The Carbon Beam injects a high level of response and flex, making the board feel alive underfoot.&#160; &#160; &#160; Technology Features CORK SHOCK ABSORBER 2.0 Cork offers excellent absorption characteristics and reforms entirely without leaving any visible dents in contrast to PVC. Therefore, it is applied as a damper in the heel area of the surfboards. &#160; INNEGRA SLS SURFBOARD Innegra is the reason for the predictable feel of a polyurethane surfboard, combined with liveliness, durability, dent resistance and incredible light weight. The weight reduction was achieved by replacing fiberglass with Innegra. &#160; GRAB RAILS Grab Rails for easier freestyle tricks, durability and comfortable general riding. &#160; LIGHT TEAM CONSTRUCTION Duotone&#160;is using a more labor intensive, multi-step vacuum bag process that yields a super strong, lightweight board with a custom, hand sanded finish. The most substantial change to the light team construction, is that Duotone&#160;no longer uses a full bamboo sandwich. The cork shock absorber, which used to be concealed under the bamboo sandwich, is now clearly visible under the deck skin and allows the deck to flex and absorb shock like a custom PU board with minimal to no heel denting, thanks to the underlying reinforcements and the remarkable memory properties of cork. Pure surf board feel in an ultra light but durable construction! &#160; RESPONSIVE FLEX Using bamboo in their&#160;surf boards, Duotone&#160;takes full advantage of the dynamic qualities of this natural product. Optimized layers and the mix with composite materials help Duotone&#160;to construct powerful, agile and versatile surf boards that come with a unique flex &#8211; responsive flex! &#160; MULTIBOX All boards now come with Duotone&#39;s&#160;own Futures Fins compatible fin boxes. Two side set screws and no rear tab allow for a wider tolerance of fin fitting and ensure a perfect and tight fit every time whether you&#8217;re using Duotone&#39;s&#160;high quality composite fins or any stock after market Futures brand fin. Easy to install and uninstall even with Sand and Salt.</description>

Product Information Duotone Wam SLS 2023 Surfboard Lightweight all-round surfboard from Duotone The&#160;Duotone Wam SLS 2023 Surfboard&#160;really needs no introduction. The Wam SLS is one of the most popular surfboards on the market thanks to its versatility. The Wam SLS 2023 is a real all-rounder with the perfect features to handle all conditions. Thanks to its versatility, the Duotone Wam SLS is the ideal surfboard for a large audience, from advanced to pro. The Wam SLS accelerates in all types of conditions. From small onshore waves to booming down-the-line surf, the Duotone Wam SLS is your go-to surfboard! The Duotone Wam SLS has a light team construction. In this construction, instead of a full bamboo surfboard, a cork shock absorber is used, which used to be hidden under a bamboo sandwich. Thanks to the use of cork, the deck is more mobile, so that shocks are better absorbed compared to a PU surfboard. Thanks to this construction you get the real surf feeling when you&#39;re on the wave! The Duotone Wam SLS has a carbon Innegra finish. With this finish, the fiberglass is replaced by Innegra. The Innegra gives the surfboard a predictive feel and combines that with vibrancy, durability, dent resistance and an incredibly lightweight surfboard. Because bamboo is used in the construction, the Wam SLS has a responsive flex. This flex ensures that the surfboard feels directly under your feet, making carving easier. The Wam SLS should not be missed in your surfboard quiver! The rails are equipped with grab rails, so you can effortlessly grab the surfboard during freestyle tricks or when you&#39;re in the middle of the wave for extra style points.

<description>
The MITU BAMBOO offer the fantastic MITU shape in a simple package using the excellent properties of natural bamboo for a light, responsive and durable board. Super agile and reactive outline Fun all around surfboard Easy speed, light, playful Amazing chop handling The MITU has been known for its super agile and reactive outline. Its distinct swallow tail makes it very easy to initiate turns and carve with. The shape has been improved this year with lateral flat sections on the bottom as well as a flat section on the bottom between your front and back foot to give directional stability. The rocker line allows a better edge control and an overall improved feeling in all conditions. This year, volume, stability and float are perfectly balanced for a board which surfs better than never before. The board smoothes out rough situations and makes you ride longer. The range goes from 5&#8217;2 all the way to 5&#8217;10. The largest sizes have a bit more emphasis on the planing ability and general stability, while the smaller sizes have more focus on manoeuvrability. All share the same shape features with their specific outline to make the most of the wave&#8217;s energy. Built with a full bamboo layers on the bottom and two on the deck, the boards are incredibly durable and remain lightweight. Equipped with a tail pad, some foot strap inserts and with three Futures boxes the MITU PRO BAMBOO comes with&#160;the possibility to add a front pad as an option if desired.</description>

KEY FEATURES BEST ALL-ROUNDER&#160;A CLASSIC SURF SHAPE IS THE GUARANTEE FOR A GREAT ALL-ROUNDER. BALANCE OF GRIP AND SNAPS&#160;EXCELLENT BALANCE OF GRIP AND EXPLOSIVE SNAPS OFF THE TOP. FAST AND STABLE&#160;SPEED IN COMBINATION WITH ABSOLUTE CONTROL IS THE MAGIC COMBINATION. VACUUM BAMBOO TEC CONSTRUCTION&#160;A CLASSIC CONSTRUCTION COMBINING THE BEST ELEMENTS OF FLEX AND FEEL IN A DURABLE CONSTRUCTION. CORK SHOCK ABSORBER&#160;THE CORK SHOCK ABSORBER IS APPLIED AS A DAMPER IN THE HEEL AREA OF THE SURFBOARD TO AVOID HEEL DENTS. CONCAVE DECK WITH GRAB RAIL&#160;TO OPTIMIZE VOLUME DISTRIBUTION TO AID CONTROL AND A SUBTLE GRAB RAIL FOR STRAPLESS TRICKS. TECH FEATURES CORK SHOCK ABSORBER&#160;Cork offers excellent absorption characteristics and reforms entirely without leaving any visible dents in contrast to PVC. Therefore, it is applied as a damper in the heel area of the surfboards. RESPONSIVE FLEX&#160;Using bamboo in our surf boards, we take full advantage of the dynamic qualities of this natural product. Optimized layers and the mix with composite materials help us to construct powerful, agile and versatile surf boards that come with a unique flex &#8211; responsive flex! STRAPPED OR STRAPLESS&#160;Board is delivered with inserts so straps can be mounted. GRAB RAILS&#160;Grab Rails for easier freestyle tricks, durability and comfortable general riding. CLASSIC CONSTRUCTION&#160;This classic layup is the result of all our years of development to create a durable, all-round strapped&#8201;/&#8201;strapless construction that combines the best elements of flex and feel with a durable construction that is proven to be far superior in strength to weight ratio than any other technology available. PLEASE NOTE: Inspired by the Light Team Construction the bottom of the Classic Construction now offers two light weight bamboo strips and an unidirectional glass beam outside the lamination to prevent buckling. BAMBOO TECH&#160;Bamboo is a sustainable material and comes with amazing technical characteristics. Our bamboo tech surfboards feature a high strength to weight ratio with great resistance to dents and perforations. The resulting boards are very durable and provide high performance riding characteristics. MULTIBOX&#160;All boards now come with our own Futures Fins compatible fin boxes. Two side set screws and no rear tab allow for a wider tolerance of fin fitting and ensure a perfect and tight fit every time whether you&#8217;re using our high quality composite fins or any stock after market Futures brand fin. Easy to install and uninstall even with Sand and Salt. DETAILS The Wam in classic construction has also been completely re-designed from the ground up, and is exactly the same shape like the Pro Wam to remain on the cutting edge of high performance surfing. Slightly shorter and wider than it&#8217;s predecessor and with more width and volume under the front foot, the WAM is the embodiment of the high performance squash-tail kite-surfboard. At home in everything from small onshore waves to pumping down-the-line surf, the WAM will never disappoint you. The new WAM is noticeably faster, more lively and agile than the previous models thanks to a slightly narrower tail and rounder outline, giving you a dynamic and exciting ride no matter the conditions.</description>

<g:price>328.5000</g:price>
<description>
DESIGN:&#160;SMALLEST KIDS WAKE SKIMBOARD SPECIALTY:&#160;STABLE AND EASY TO RIDE RESPONSE:&#160;MEDIUM &#160; The Shrimp evolved from the growth of Wakesurfing. Now, kids are getting into the sport at a much younger age than before. We found a need for a smaller surfer than the Scamp and the Shrimp is the answer. The Design of the Shrimp is a traditional skim style board to keep the board very maneuverable and easy to control for the kids just beginning their quest to drop the rope. It&#8217;s skim style core makes it easy for kids to sink the board under their feet at start up and will allow them to get up with no problem. We equipped the Shrimp with a single 2&#8221; fin that provides plenty of traction to keep the board locked into the wave. &#160; &#160; &#160;</description>

<title>2023 North Flex LX TT Binding</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=9809</link>
<g:price>148.8500</g:price>
<description>
Cushioning. Support. Shock absorption. The all-new 2023 Flex LX have a sense of luxury that speaks to the perfect balance between performance and design. Engineered to help absorb and disperse impact after gravity-defying boosts, with triple-density dynamic support technology to protect your heels&#160;and guarantee softer landings. We&#8217;ve added structure and stability with a more contoured footbed and ramped chassis for improved fit and increased lateral support. Outer angled heel inserts ensure your foot rolls properly, providing a stable landing and protecting your knees and ankles when loading up to release into the air. The GripFlex lightweight, rubberized EVA inner maintains grip underfoot when wet, while the fine grip pattern helps keep you locked in on various angles, preventing your foot from sliding out of the binding. We&#8217;ve refined the adjustable injection-Velcro top flap to provide a strong yet flexible hold. The strap has a soft foam and KnitFlex seamless lining with split-Velcro fastenings. These provide custom comfort and allow your foot to shuffle more easily into a locked-in position. For your ultimate fit, ensure there&#39;s enough room for your toes to stretch and flex, and make sure the strap doesn&#39;t slip or rub. The upper should feel secure, but not too tight, and the footbed should match the shape of your foot. The Flex LX are compatible with both our new 2023 FlipTech centreline and 2020-2022 offline TwinTip mounting systems. Industry-standard screw spacings ensure they can also be fitted to other boards.</description>

Ozone Ignition v3 - 3-Line Universal Trainer Kite Designed to bring out the kiter within everyone, the Ignition 3-line trainer kite is smooth and stable with steady response and power to ensure easy progression into all kite sports. The Ignition V3 features our market leading Internal Landing and Re-Launch System - this unique system combined with the Wrist Leash gives you the ability to safely land the kite by yourself and guarantees easy re-launch.

Whatever your age or kiting ambitions, the Ignition V3 is the perfect trainer kite to get you started in the most exciting new sport on the planet. Children should use the 1.5m size in winds less than 10knots and always be under careful adult supervision.

<title>Ride Engine Vinaka Wingsurf V2 Harness</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=10027</link>
<g:price>130.9000</g:price>
<description>
The world&#39;s first purpose-built harness for wing foiling, the Vinaka will have you riding longer and pinching upwind more efficiently by taking the wing&#39;s weight off your arms whenever you want. The Vinaka&#39;s ultra-minimal, no-BS design of ripstop nylon and thin closed-cell foam weighs in at a mere 450 grams, so you can still fully enjoy the free feeling of wing foiling. With a shadow-like fit and sliding hook, the Vinaka virtually disappears when swimming, paddling, or riding toeside (situations where a traditional kite or windsurf harness can be a massive hassle/pain/annoyance). If you want to extend your wing foiling sessions, the Vinaka will help you stay out on the water when everyone else that&#39;s winging must head in because their arms are smoked.</description>

<description>
WHY YOU&#39;LL LOVE IT A beefed up no-compromise wide body Phantasm mast capable of handling the torque from big boards and the largest foil wings. Our Phantasm construction starts from the ground up, utilizing our proprietary dual-molding process. Each mast is laid up to precise specifications with unidirectional and 12K premium-quality, super-high-modulus pre-preg carbon. Inside is a dual-carbon core that ensures next-level stiffness in major, minor and biaxial directions. Running lengthwise between the dual core is a I-beam constructed from 12K and 24K carbon that creates the third and final layer of rigidity and solidity. WHY WE MADE IT We wanted a beefed up extra stiff mast capable of handling the high torque loads from big boards and big foil wings. We also wanted a big, solid footplate connection to the fuselage that inspired rider confidence and enforced the overall rigidity of the platform. &#8226;Each mast is laid up to precise specifications with unidirectional and 12K premium-quality, super-high-modulus pre-preg carbon. &#8226;Bigfoot Connection: The Phantasm&#39;s mast-to-foil connection is more than 50% larger than our competitors. This increased size makes it the strongest and most robust in the industry. &#8226;Extra-large pedestal base for a rock-solid connection to your board with tons of adjustability. The wide-body masts feature 4 holes of adjustability in the front and 3 holes in the back.</description>

&#160; F-One Gravity 2200 FCT Foil Set Includes: FW GRAVITY FCT 2200 + ALU FUSELAGE 74 SURF + STAB IC6 300 [F-One Gravity 2200 FCT Foil Set] The foils of the Gravity line are designed to provide a solid lift with a smooth take-off and great carving potential. Right in the line of its best-selling carbon sibling, this new Gravity is the ideal foil to get started and progress in wing-foiling and surf-foiling. A Gravity foil is an intuitive foil to use. It generates lift at low (and even very low) speed but does it in a smooth way so you can keep your balance easily. The wings are designed to be easy to roll and turn, so they can perform in the surf. Smooth take-off Stability and lift Easy to turn Area:&#160;2195 cm sq Span:&#160;110 cm Aspect Ratio:&#160;5.5 Weight:&#160;2 kg (wing only) Alu Fuselage:&#160;74 Surf The Gravity has its dimensions optimized to provide enough lift to get anyone flying. We made sure to keep the drag limited to maintain a thrilling feeling of glide. The span is generous making it a very stable foil and the refined shape details such as the arch curvature, the profile and the wing tips insure it remains highly maneuverable. The wing is covered using a thin but strong protective layer to protect it from scratches and digs. It is built in fiberglass around an injected foam core and fits on a streamlined, aluminum fuselage. The two connect via a large, solid plate at the front of the fuselage ensuring a very solid and stiff bond between the wing and the fuselage. The fuselage can be connected to the standard F-ONE aluminum mast of the desired length. The setup and disassembly are also super easy and the whole is very travel friendly. The Gravity comes with the IC6 300 stab. This stabilizer offers easy take-off and good directional stability for a secure feel which is perfect when riding. Built using the IC6 technology, it is both strong and durable.</description>

ION&#39;s harness ergonomics provide the perfect fit for each individual&#39;s body size and shape. The harness outline derives from body height and girth, ranging from high to low with intermediate sizes. The exchangeable Ergo_Pad on the inside offers optimal lumbar support in two profiles (each harness comes with two options - medium and high support - choose what suits you best). The Riot Curv Team Series is the most rigid harness in ION&#39;s range (flex index 18) and offers a direct and agile feeling. An ultra-lightweight Curv construction distributes forces evenly throughout the harness. At the same time, it&#39;s flexible enough to allow for perfect freedom of movement. Non-water-absorbent Hyer_Foam contributes to the overall ergonomic fit and lightweight while the Neoprene_Belt provides flexibility in the front. ION&#39;s sleek Spectre Bar (including kite hook) completes the Riot Curv Team Series. Its Curv_Flaps create a seamless and optimal force distribution throughout the harness. Comes with integrated Knite_Knife Multitool 2.0 and HPL_Slider.</description>

Description: ION&#39;s Neo Top 0.5 LS men has a more detailed and technical construction than standard rashguards, providing 100% UV protection, efficient heat retention, and a reduction in irritation and bruising, often caused by the harness or surfboard. The flexible outside lining makes you forget you&#39;re wearing a top because of its outstanding stretch characteristics. On the inside, Silk_Stuff increases next-to-skin comfort to the max. Fused edges round of this technical long sleeve making it sturdier and ready for countless sessions. Features: Max_Flex Max_Flex is our latest innovation in flexibility and stretch. The unique rhombus-shaped structure of this lining material allows it to be more flexible. Further does the material itself not soak up water but redistributes it on the surface thru small channels. This increases the evaporation of water and reduces drying time. Fused Edges Embossed sleeve and leg ends for a sleeker and more durable finish. Slip_Loop Easily connect your neoprene top with this loop to your bottom and keep everything in place. Silk_Stuff Smooth inside lining for a comfortable feeling on bare skin. Despite its snuggly appearance it proves to be really hard core when it comes to the interior&#39;s superb flexible characteristics.

Draw_Cord on hem Secure a safe fit around the waist without the hassle of adjusting your pants all the time. Materials: 80% Neopren 20% Nylon</description>

Cutting edge pumping performance to complement the APF front foil range. &#160; The Pump 202 is designed specifically to complement the Armstrong Pump Foil (APF) front foil range. This stabiliser redefines pump foiling potential with its ultra-low stall speeds, incredible stability and high efficiency to take you further with less effort than ever. &#160; Easy to fly with ultra-low stall speeds Pitch stable to help build a natural pumping cadence Co-designed with aerospace engineer Chris Porter &#160; Achieve maximum time on foil If you&#8217;re just learning or already seasoned, a forgiving foil that helps keep you flying makes all the difference when building your pumping skills. The APF&#8217;s outline shape, straight leading edge and high camber foil section offer ultra low stall speeds, quick acceleration and a relaxed, efficient pumping cadence optimised for exploring flat water or cruising effortlessly on micro bumps. Set up for rock solid stability The APF delivers pitch stability in key phases of flight without completely sacrificing sensitivity and manoeuvrability for expert riders. The specially designed high camber Pump 202 stabiliser works in harmony with the APF to provide excellent pitch stability throughout the entire pump cycle. This solid feeling underfoot lets you focus on building your technique and developing efficiency to go further than ever before. Designed with Chris Porter Designed in collaboration with career aerospace engineer Chris Porter, the APF foil shares its DNA with his reputed Crisp 333 and 381 stabilisers. Our approach to finding gains across all areas of the foil design have led to a pump foil that&#8217;s truly designed from tip to tip for the discipline. &#160; Recommendations: PUMP FOIL:&#160;All weights Specifications: Span:&#160;397mm Area:&#160;202cm2 Aspect Ratio:&#160;7.8</description>

<description>
Welcome to the newest, easiest and most fun to effort ratio water sport. Efoiling! It combines surfing, foiling wakeboarding all without the ocean or the boat. The electric engine powers the board at your fingertip. Although it depends on the individual, the average person can learn to efoil in less than an hour. Families of 4 can usually pick it up in 2-3 hours together, if they have some experience in similar sports. Our highly skilled instructor has taught men and women from 7-77. The first part of the lesson is spent familiarizing the control systems and safety. We the progress to belly and knee riding. Once there we get up and riding.&#160; Once we are surfing we progress to riding the foil. Each student is different with differing levels of experience in these sports so be patient with yourself. On the fly we will design a program to get you surfing then flying on the water. Additional lessons can add to your expertise. Make no mistake, this is the best and easiest way to learn to foil. If you want to surf-foil, wing, kite, or sup foil this is the way to start.&#160; Efoiling can open this whole world to you, let Jupiter kiteboarding show you how. **** There are NO Refunds for Lessons/Rentals. A Store credit will be issued to any client who wishes not to&#160;complete their lesson/rentals package. There is no expiration to the credit issued, and you can apply to anything on our site, or share with a friend.</description>

<description>
Winging evolution has been rapidly developing and it&#39;s the fastest growing water sport right now. It&#39;s in its infancy, growing quickly and making a huge impact on the watersports community. WingFoiling is like a cross between Foiling and kiteboarding, that borrows the best of both worlds. We use a hand-held Wing to power a SUP board or foilboard. The new Wing designs have propelled this new sport into the spotlight. WingFoiling has already taken off and is quickly attracting followers around Jupiter and Stuart, Florida. Some people describe WingFoiling as less extreme than kiteboarding, with more freedom than Foiling, which adds to its over all appeal. WingFoiling Lessons: We now offer WingFoiling and WingSurf-foiling lessons for all levels, beginner to advanced. We provide all the gear and equipment to get you out on the water. Your Instructor can help recommend you the best equipment for your level and the conditions. Wings come in a variety of sizes to suit different riders.&#160; Learning to WingFoil or WingSurf is a great way to harness the wind and engage with the water. WingFoiling combines using a free moving hand-held wing while standing on a foilboard / surfboard. Our instructors are 20 years experienced and will show you the basics on land, and in the calmer waters closer to shore. No experience is necessary. All participants must be able to swim.&#160; Jupiter Kiteboarding Wing-Foiling is the perfect lesson for an individual, family or friends, with no previous experience, who wish to learn the fundamental skills that lead to safe and self sufficient at, wing surfing, wing foiling, wing boarding, we create the best learning environment and tailor the instruction to each individual student to boost your progress.&#160; We&#160;choose the Stuart Causeway Park location with sandy beaches and flat water and we only ride&#160;when the weather conditions are suitable.&#160; Please call 561-427-0240 and choose option 3 from the menu. &#160; **** There are NO Refunds for Lessons. A Store credit will be issued to any client who wishes not to&#160;complete their lesson package.

<title>Manera X10D Split Toe Wetsuit Boots 3mm</title>

<description>
Most of us delay the boots time as much as possible, We feel like we lose the board feeling, we&#8217;re less precise, our feet slide inside. Many reasons that pushed us to design our own range. We offer boots for those who don&#8217;t like boots: They keep you warm and comfy, but they are made to be forgotten once in the water while still offering great foot support. X10D Jersey The X10D inside layer is the most flexible material you can find on a suit, it makes you feel stretch and light, with a good feeling on the skin. Donut cuff Our boots are closed by a donut cuff which prevents any water from coming in and fill up the boot. Sealing prints The sealing print around the shin brings a better grip between the wetsuit and the boot. Coupled with the wetsuit SEALING PRINT, it prevents the wetsuit&#8217;s leg from rolling up. Split toe X10D boots feature a split toe. It offers a great foot support and a more natural movement. Foot support Foot support is essential to get a comfortable and performing neoprene boot. MANERA boots feature &#8220;SIDEWALLS&#8221; on each side of the foot to maintain it. We also use a stiffer neoprene around the front of the foot in order to hold the boot structure. Without these features the foot would be able to slide or the boot would deform, which would lead the user to lose his balance, lack precision or even get hurt. Direct drive MANERA soles are super thin in order to keep a direct and precise contact between the foot and the board. The micro-spikes on the sole provide a perfect grip on wax or on a pad.</description>

Infos &amp; Characteristics It&#8217;s very frustrating to be cold when riding in a warm place. That is why we designed our HYBRID shorty to be warm. It is packed with the same technologies as the 3.2mm steamer: we basically just cut the legs. The SEAFARER brings us back to the essentials of what makes a good wetsuit, nothing more, nothing less: warmth, stretch, durability. It&#39;s a no-bullshit wetsuit with Manera&#8217;s renowned fit and construction. If you are looking for a high-performance wetsuit at an affordable price, this is the right choice.</description>

<g:price>599.0000</g:price>
<description>
The Whip is a unique board in the entire Zap Line featuring RidgeGrip&#8482; technology. John Akerman asked for a place to grip the board while grabbing the rail and RidgeGrip&#8482; was born. The midsection of the board has a 3/4&#8221; rail ridge that tapers down to a 5/8&#8221; core throughout the middle of the board. This creates ergonomic comfort hand grip and unique performance. The 5/8&#8221; core in the center maintains a very responsive and fast ride. The 3/4&#8221; rail provides extra floatation like a thicker core, giving the best of both worlds. The Whip is rounded out with our super tough GatorSkin&#8482; glass.

HSA is the only company to produce a line of tow ropes and handles specific to tow surfing. We continually source new materials to bring you the most advanced equipment possible. All ropes &amp; handles have safety, function and craftsmanship built in. Please bear in mind, that these tow ropes are not for heavy static pulling. These ropes were not designed for dragging your PWC on the sand on a remote beach with your truck. The Hybrid A marriage of the old School and the Cushy to give you the best of both world. The Old School (Our first tow specific rope) Tow surfers have loved this rope for years. The &quot;old school&quot; is the first rope we produced specific to tow surfing. - 1 1/4&quot; diameter hollow core polypropylene material. All ropes floats &amp; do not absorb water. - All HSA ropes Incorporate a Delron thimble (PWC attachment point) to eliminate wear on polypropylene material - Protective vinyl sheath from the PWC contact point out 10 feet greatly reduces the risk of rope being sucked into an intake grate. - Strong, light and is less drag in areas where windy conditions and high seas are commonCost The Cushy All the evolution and technology of the &quot;Old School&quot; rope above combined with new materials and innovations - 2 1/2&quot; of hollow core polypropylene material - All the evolution and technology of the &quot;Old School&quot; rope above combined with new materials and innovations - The large material diameter of this rope is forgiving, easy to grab even after a day of towing with tired hands The last 10&#8217; of this rope is filled with float foam, which serves the dual role of maintaining the ropes circumference, as well as making it the easiest rope to &#8220;short- hand&quot; The slight elasticity built into the rope reduces the fatigue a day &quot;on the rope&quot; causes.</description>

Infos &amp; Characteristics We believe it is frustrating to be cold when the weather is nice &amp; warm. This technical wetshirt features an outside layer that prevents the wind-chill effect; and an inside plush that keeps you warm without using a bulky neoprene top or a spring suit. &#160; Designed with a tee-shirt loose fit and a 4 Way-stretch, it ensures you stay comfy out there.</description>

NEO TOPS are a must-have for every watersports nut hitting the sea or surf in milder climates. Although mainly used in warmer waters to keep the sun and wind off the skin, they can also be used as a second layer underneath your wetsuit. Thanks to the plush, wool-like inside lining, these tops have a luxurious texture that feels great, even on bare skin! The NEO TOPS have a more detailed and technical construction than that of the standard Rashguard, providing 100% UV protection, efficient heat retention and a reduction in irritations and bruising often caused by the harness or surfboard.</description>

<description>
These hollow leashes are perfect for foil surfing or wing foiling. These leashes float, which prevents them from getting caught around the foil. It also comes with three movable EVA floats to keep the end of the leash from sinking and getting wrapped on the foil. These leashes are good up to 8&#39; swell and feature a removable neoprene cuff. Replace the cuff with the Dura-cord line, and it attaches perfectly to our wing waist leash. It comes in 7&#39; Strait and 7&#39; coil options.&#160;</description>

The PTM 730 will accelerate and track at higher speeds to deliver a rock solid platform for unmatched glide and stability for long drawn out jibes and tacks. The larger span (655 cm2) of the PTM 730 front wing and its High Aspect shape and design yields the perfect blend of speed and tracking. If you are looking for the perfect balance of speed and stability the PTM will deliver all of the performance you need and more. The wing&#39;s unique inverted gull wing shape not only provides insane speed but also delivers a game-changing self-leveling flight that governs your height no matter how fast you go. The PTM 730/710 Lower package was built to provide you with a maximum blend of Freeride speed and efficiencies, this foil will open up new lines, and new abilities for your foiling repertoire. &#8226;The perfect balance of speed and stability &#8226;Perfect your turns and transitions with more glide and stability than any other foil &#8226;Ride faster and more locked it; delivering a rock-solid platform for boosting PTM 730 FRONT WING This larger high aspect wing provides hero-level speed and tracking. Riders that are looking for the best speed, best efficiencies, and locked-in feel will find nothing better than the PTM 730.

BIGFOOT CONNECTION The Phantasm mast to foil connection is over 50% larger than our competitors, this increased size makes it the strongest and most robust in the industry. &#160; NEOPRENE WING COVERS AND TRAVEL CASE Protect your foil whether you are simply heading to the beach or heading around the world. Your foil comes complete with both a travel bag and durable neoprene wing covers.</description>

New for 2020 is the full carbon, low profile FoilMount 3.0 Carbon This compressed carbon plate is not only beautiful it is also incredibly strong allowing it to be thinner than the original FoilMount.&#160; This setup weighs just over 1lb so it is also about 30% lighter than previous models.&#160; The new curved shape along with it&#39;s light weight and thinner profile make it incredibly low drag in the water.&#160; You cannot tell there is a track mounted on the bottom of your board while using it without a hydrofoil.&#160; We have also upgraded the included hardware.&#160; Because this system is so thin we had to invent a new hardware set that would work with any base plate on the market call the Wizardhat Hardware.&#160; Each FoilMount 3.0 Carbon includes a set of 4 Wizardhat hardware and they will allow you to attach any hydrofoil on the market to your FoilMount.&#160;&#160; Features: -New Carbon Fiber bulletproof construction -CNC milled tracks and edges -Bubble channels in adhesive to decrease bubbles while installing -Flexible edges and center-line to accommodate more board geometry. -New more efficient shape -Lighter design weighs 30% less than FoilMount 2.0 Includes: -FoilMount 3.0 Carbon plate with adhesive back -Installation and preparation materials -4 sets of Wizardhat hardware -Instructions Dimensions: Track spacing: 90mm Track length: 235mm (9.28in) FoilMount Weight: 1.2lbs</description>

<g:price>15.0000</g:price>
<description>
&#160; Universal strut bladders with no valves attached. Purchase our U-STICK valves separately to assemble replacements for almost any kite ever made. Yeah....we invented &#39;em and we publish a handy dandy sizing chart for the most common kites. Made right here in our own factory in the USA. The bladders are measured from the head to tail in inches (we fudge a bit because we know the bladder can be longer but CAN&#39;T be shorter than the original). If you have your bladder out measure head to tail and choose whatever size is equal or longer to your original (don&#39;t fudge on the measurement or you&#39;ll get yourself in trouble). Or just check the sizing chart, we probably list your kite. We use only the highest quality US made polyurethane film for these bladders.. It&#39;s super stretchy, can handle abrasion, and moves easy when installing. &#160;</description>

<description>
PWC&#39;s were never designed or engineered to accommodate Rescue Boards. Our extensive time on the water has proven that basic wear can occur between the PWC and rescue board interface. HSA addresses this by creating numerous mount kits depending on the year, make and model of your PWC. **Please specify when ordering between Honda, Yamaha, Sea Doo and Kawasaki.** - Strategically placed hardware and abrasion material allow the rescue board to function seamlessly with your PWC. - Reduces wear &amp; tear on PWC and rescue board. - Properly rigged a rescue board provides a smoother ride for people and payload &#160;</description>

<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=9257</link>
<g:price>99.9500</g:price>
<description>
INNOVATION AND THOUGHTFUL DESIGN ARE AT OUR HEART, THE NEW POWERLINK CONTROL BAR IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF OUR DEDICATION TO THE DESIGN ETHOS. During the testing of the A-Wing, Armie developed the Powerlink Control Bar with the goal of increasing the handling and range of the A-Wing. Linking the middle handles allows for easy hand transfers, enhanced wing control during transitions and for wave riding. It improves light wind power, with both hands on the bar it sets the wing higher and further from body turbulence, which improves low-end grunt. It also adds to upper-end wind range by allowing your rear hand to move forward for the optimal control position in powered conditions. Although the Power Control Bar has been developed primarily for the A-Wing, as an added bonus it can also easily be fitted to many other brands wings. Power link control Bar length is 520mm (Please check the length of other brand fitting points)</description>

<g:price>2499.9900</g:price>
<description>
Armstrong&#39;s next generation foils. MA (Mid Aspect) takes everything they&#39;ve learned from the HS, HA and CF V2 ranges and delivers a truly next-gen combination of glide, low stall speed, intuitive carving and instantaneous breach recovery. These foils offer the best of all worlds to experienced riders in every foil sport. STELLAR GLIDE AND ACCELERATION A specially tuned leading edge shape gives MA foils stellar glide and highly responsive acceleration. They&#8217;re a dream to pump when connecting wave sets, downwinding in open ocean swell, or riding way back on a boat wake. LOW END LIFT AND BROAD SPEED RANGE Thanks to its high camber foil section, the MA range delivers a unique blend of lift at low speeds yet retains excellent controllability at the top end. This makes getting onto foil and pumping easier while reducing your chances of being &#8220;over foiled&#8221; in big conditions. FLUID CARVING There&#8217;s nothing better than feeling connected to the foil through a turn, which is why we&#8217;ve designed the MA foils to deliver seamless and intuitive control through the full range of bank angles. LIGHTNING FAST VENTILATION RECOVERY From breaching a wingtip in the surf to landing an air, the MA range handles ventilation with ease. A fine leading edge section and tuned wingtip inflection allow for quick flow reattachment after a breach, making these foils the perfect platform for practicing aerials or ripping the hardest turns of your foiling journey. MA800 The highly rippable performance machine. Specifications Projected Area: 800cm2 Span: 765mm AR: 7.32 Angle relative to fuselage: 1.5 deg. Rider Recommendations Wing: Intermediate-Advanced Prone Surf: Advanced SUP Surf: Advanced Kite: Intermediate-Advanced &#160; What&#8217;s included? MA800 Front Wing, Flow 235 Stabilizer, 85cm v2 Plate mast, TC60cm V2 Fuselage, Shims, Carry Bag, and all necessary hardware + Torx tool.&#160; This kit is the highly rippable performance foil. Perfect for accomplished riders: Kiting, tow, Surf, and wing foiling! Options to swap the fuselage and mast. &#160; &#160; &#160;</description>

<title>2023 Ion Kite Waist Apex</title>

<g:price>339.9900</g:price>
<description>
New within ION&#39;s Ergo_Concept, the Apex is the perfect harness for everyone who&#39;s looking for flexibility combined with good back support. With a flex index of 8, it belongs to the medium rigid harnesses. Developed with the rider&#39;s health in mind, the Apex features an exchangeable Ergo_Pad on the inside. The pad is characterized by its integrated channel, different thicknesses and elevated trigger points on the outside. These prevent lower back injuries, reduce pain and increase comfort. Both pads are included and attached with a very robust velcro. Just try both and go with the one you feel more comfortable with. Flexible side parts and an internal flex belt allow for good mobility. The 3D_Plus spine reinforces back support. The result is a sound balance between freedom of movement and support through a high outline. The harness comes with a lightweight thanks to the partly Curv construction, non-water absorbent HD_Foam, and the sleek Spectre Bar (kite hook included). The Curv_Flaps of the Spectre bar create a seamless and optimal force distribution throughout the harness. The Apex comes with an integrated Kite_Knife Multitool 2.0.</description>

NEO TOPS are a must-have for every watersports nut hitting the sea or surf in milder climates. Although mainly used in warmer waters to keep the sun and wind off the skin, they can also be used as a second layer underneath your wetsuit. Thanks to the plush, wool-like inside lining, these tops have a luxurious texture that feels great, even on bare skin! The NEO TOPS have a more detailed and technical construction than that of the standard Rashguard, providing 100% UV protection, efficient heat retention and a reduction in irritations and bruising often caused by the harness or surfboard.</description>

<g:price>69.9900</g:price>
<description>
OUR ADJUSTABLE CARBON TRACK TAIL KICK PAD TAKES THE DESIGN INTO THE NEXT LEVEL. We understand that foot position is crucial to maintain maximum control at all times, it is also unique to every rider due to weight and height. We designed our tail pad to run on a carbon plate that has adjustable positions, which means you can set the tail kick in just the right place so your rear foot is located in the perfect position every time. &#160; We&#8217;ve found that it is good to start foiling with your back foot placed directly above the mast, this is the natural position. Once up and riding you can experiment putting your back foot just in front or just behind the mast to find what is your ideal positioning for your weight size and style. &#160;</description>

<description>
FINS FLOW&#160;XS Carbon PAPAYA The F-ONE surf fins have been developed to optimize the efficiency of our shapes. Their outline, stiffness, and profile were designed specifically for surfing with a kite, which means different requirements than for prone surfing. The FLOW series was developed for versatility and high performances over a wide range of conditions. Using the RTM construction paired with a carbon strip, the FINS FLOW CARBON generate more speed and deliver controlled flex and enhanced base stiffness. Their XS size provides more freedom to the board under the traction of the kite, bringing better maneuverability and control. &#160;</description>

<title>F-One Phantom Carbon Foils V3</title>

<description>
The foils of the Phantom line are designed to glide effortlessly when pumping or connecting waves and then prove very agile and precise when surfing. Speed and maneouvrability Radical turns Efficient pumping Using a refined design to achieve higher finesse, the Phantom foils glide faster and for longer. Connecting waves whether during surfing or downwinding thereby becomes much easier and more fun. Yet, connecting waves isn&#8217;t much fun if you can&#8217;t turn and this is why carving is also part of the DNA of the Phantom foils. By working on the lift distribution, arch shape and other details we achieved a high-aspect, performance foil that can carve smooth curves on the waves and swells. Built using the Monobloc construction with pre-preg carbon, the foils are both very light and really strong. This set-up offers better load transmission and better stiffness throughout the different parts for maximum control. The Titan connection allows to plug both an aluminium or carbon mast and the fuselage is split in two parts to facilitate transportation. The Phantom wings are recommended with the C275 Surf stab. This stabilizer offers better glide and a looser feel. It&#8217;s the ideal match for the speed and glide of the Phantom wings. The looser feel will help turning these higher aspect wings and provide an awesome surfing experience. The Phantom 940 is a concentrate of speed that allows radical carves and a surprisingly efficient pumping. It is aimed at an experienced and demanding rider, its potential is to be exploited in wing or in waves &gt;1m. The Phantom 1080 is a remarkably efficient foil that remains accessible despite its small surface area. It is surprisingly easy to use, but reveals incredible performance in speed, carving and pumping when needed. The Phantom 1280 provides a versatile program similar to the 1480, but with a bit more power: It carves better, goes faster, and is used in more powerful waves. It is also suitable for lighter riders (&lt;70kg). The Phantom 1480 combines efficiency and accessibility. Its lift allows you to glide endlessly while having fun thanks to its incredible maneuverability. It is an ultra versatile kite: surfing in waves &lt;1m50, downwind, wing, dockstarts, wakefoil&#8230; It does everything, and well. The Phantom 1780 offers the highest lift of the range. It allows a very versatile program similar to the 1480, but more adapted to heavier riders (&gt;85kg), or SUPs.</description>

The SPECTRE-Bar is ION&#39;s latest innovation in spreader bar technology. It features a slim outline and is made from forged carbon C30 which makes it also incredibly light. Thanks to the bar&#39;s stiff properties, it provides direct feedback. A super-slim EVA pad minimizes pressure points so you can focus only on your riding. Integrated Spectre Flaps on each side made out of Curv material prevent twisting of the bar while still following your movements. The tension lever system guarantees an easy on and off of the harness without having to change the webbings. The Spectre Bar comes with the all-new Quicklock hook. ION offers a modular hook system which means you can exchange the hook on the fly or opt for the Dyneema webbing slider.</description>
