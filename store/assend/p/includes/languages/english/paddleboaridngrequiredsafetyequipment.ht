<div style="margin: 40px;"><br><p align="center"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Paddleboarding is a rapidly growing sport that involves a person standing on a board, similar to a surfboard, and propelling themselves thorugh the water with the use of a paddle</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><img width="650" height="225" class="pageimages" alt="safety" src="images/required_safety_equipment.jpg" /></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Did you know the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has determined that a paddleboard is a vessel in most situations and is required to have the same safety equiment as other small human-powered vessels (canoes/kayaks)?</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Here is what this means if you are using a paddleboard:</span></span></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Unless the paddleboard is being used within a &ldquo;swimming, surfing or bathing area,&rdquo; the paddleboard must have a USCG-approved life jacket for each person and a sound-producing device on board while on the water.</span></span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Although persons on the paddleboard are not required to wear the life jacket while on Florida waters (unless they are less than 6 years of age), it is advisable to find a comfortable life jacket that you can wear or easily carry while on the water.</span></span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A &ldquo;sound-producing device&rdquo; is a small whistle or horn that can be heard for at least one-half nautical mile. &ldquo;Referee-type&rdquo; whistles or other similar devices that can be attached to your life jacket should work well.</span></span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">If you are operating in limited visibility or at night, you will also need a flashlight or lantern that produces a white light. It should be displayed to approaching vessels in enough time to prevent a collision. The light should not be continually displayed.</span></span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">If using a paddleboard offshore or on certain coastal waters at nighttime, visual distress signals may be required, per the Code of Federal Regulations.</span></span></li>
</ul>
