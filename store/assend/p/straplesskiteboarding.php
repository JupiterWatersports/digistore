     <h1><strong>Strapless Riding </strong><strong>by Jon Modica</strong></h1>
     <p>Most  people spend a good portion of their lives searching for that "ultimate"  feeling, hobby, or sport.&nbsp; For me, strapless kiteboarding has allowed me  to express that ultimate form of freedom. Jeremy at Jupiter Kiteboarding has  asked me to share my strapless riding experiences.&nbsp; Here are some of my  thoughts and recommendations based on my experiences and board theory. </p>
     <h1><strong>Let's Talk Boards</strong></h1>
     <p>The first and most important thing I  need to mention is that there is not one board that fits all riding.&nbsp; Make  sure you pick a board for the local conditions.&nbsp; If you live in a place  that blows over 16 knots or so consistently, you can ride a more traditional  surfboard.&nbsp; For places like Jupiter, I recommend something a bit more  lightwind-friendly.&nbsp; Jupiter has a lot of smaller wave days where a 6'1"  just isn't going to be fun.</p>
     <p><br />
       A board that gets loose and gets  going quickly in light air can turn a mediocre session into a lot of fun.&nbsp;  Strapless boards are always a balance between control and  maneuverability.&nbsp; Add a wider tail, and you get planning earlier, but max  out your bottom turns.&nbsp; Add concavity and you can turn on a dime, but  start to reach a max speed earlier.&nbsp; Quads are a great thing, but be  cautious of losing feel if you're a back foot heavy rider like myself.&nbsp;  For kiting, I prefer boards with a little wider nose.&nbsp; A long board seems  to catch wind and chop more.&nbsp; Also, when doing airs, a wider nose helps me  keep the board to my feet, without losing the volume needed.&nbsp; </p>
     <h1><strong>Your First Time Out</strong></h1>
     <p>The first time you go out, you're  going to be frustrated, confused, and probably get a few cuts on your feet, but  ultimately, you will have an amazing new experience. Try and wait for a day  that you feel comfortable riding, something like 13-18 knots with small to no  waves.&nbsp; Welcome to the best thing in the world!<br />
       You're inherently going to want to  be able to "do it all" right away, but let's take it one step at a time.Here is  a list of things to do in the order I feel makes the most sense. Most of these  aren't thorough or complete, but here is a start...</p>
     <ol start="1" type="1">
       <li><strong>Going upwind</strong> - Just play around and get used to going upwind. I think you'll find it to       be a lot easier than with a twin tip!</li>
       <li><strong>Practice gybing</strong> - There are many ways to gybe, but all of them require a simple two-step       process.&nbsp; First take your back foot and move it next to your front,       then take your original front and move it back.&nbsp; KEEP THIS       SIMPLE!&nbsp; NO jumping to switch stance AND DONT DO THIS IN REVERSE       ORDER!!</li>
       <li><strong>Toeside       turns</strong> - These are great to help you       learn to ride waves.</li>
       <li><strong>Strapless Air</strong> - Eventually you'll want to jump and do airs.&nbsp; DO NOT GRAB THE BOARD.       DO NOT GRAB THE BOARD. DO NOT GRAB THE BOARD.&nbsp; You will never learn       to balance the board properly under your feet if you're always reaching       down for it.&nbsp; Your goal for jumping should be to hit a small wave and       learn to "balance" the board under your front foot.&nbsp; It helps to push       down on the tail at take-off to get the nose up.&nbsp; From there you just       need to feel it out.&nbsp; It takes A LOT of practice.&nbsp; Have fun with       it and be patient!</li>
       <li><strong>Tack or 360 spin</strong> -&nbsp; I love this trick. It's not that hard, but a great way to       transition and impress your buddies.&nbsp; You want to transition your       kite from low to high very smoothly.&nbsp; As your kite gets almost to       neutral you need to be almost at a halt.&nbsp; Throw the rotation right       when the kite gets to 12 o'clock.&nbsp; Throw the nose up like you are       about to do a back roll on a twin tip, but slide your tail when doing it       so you don't leave the water.&nbsp; (It will make sense when you try       it)&nbsp; After the spin, dive the kite fairly hard to get going again!</li>
       <li><strong>180 Ollie</strong> - A really fun trick.&nbsp; Start by doing a standard 180 riding heelside       and then try the more popular toeside 180 later on.&nbsp; The key to the       trick is to always be rotating.&nbsp; In other words, don't try to jump -       get high up, and then rotate.&nbsp; Start it early and continue it through       till landing.&nbsp; When you rotate, you help the board stick to your       feet.</li>
       <li><strong>Back roll</strong> - Not an easy trick, but a lot of fun.&nbsp; Learn by hitting a steep face       and push the board really vertical so it wants to come into your hand       naturally.&nbsp; If you are reaching too far, you will have a hard time       rotating around.&nbsp; Wherever you look your body tends to rotate, so       start the rotation early!</li>
     </ol>
