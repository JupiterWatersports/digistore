<b>Advanced Integration Method (AIM)</b><br>
The Advanced Integration Method is the recommended method of submitting transactions to the payment<br>gateway. This method allows a merchant's server to securely connect directly to the payment gateway to<br>submit transaction data. The merchant retains full control of the payment data collection and the user<br>experience. This method requires merchants to be able to initiate and manage secure Internet<br>connections.<br>
<b>Simple Integration Method (SIM)</b><br>
The Simple Integration Method is a relatively simple and secure method to submit transactions to the<br>

<A name=9></a>Payment Gateway. Merchants using this method have the option to let the gateway handle all the steps in<br>transaction processing-payment data collection, data submission, and response to customer. Any request<br>to the gateway is required to contain information that indicates to the gateway that the transaction is<br>authentic and has been submitted for processing with the merchant's knowledge. This information is<br>contained in a fingerprint that has to be generated by the merchant and included with every request<br>submitted to the gateway. The fingerprint is a hash generated using the HMAC-MD5 hashing algorithm on<br>a set of pre-defined transaction-specific fields. If the fingerprint cannot be validated by the gateway, the<br>request will be rejected.<br>
