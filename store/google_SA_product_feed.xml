<description>
It&#8217;s all in the name. The Flow 235&#8217;s name says it all! It&#8217;s smooth and predictable, inspiring your confidence and flow. Building on the much-loved HS232, this stabiliser adds a new section for consistent pitch stability, an increased projected aspect ratio and a refined planform to deliver an easy and free feeling ride. If you enjoy several foiling disciplines and want one stabiliser to cover them all, the Flow 235 is for you. Derived from the much-loved HS232 platform.&#160; Developed in conjunction with the new MA foil range. New section and thinner profile with more camber. Higher projected aspect ratio for improved glide. More responsive for pumping. Consistent pitch stability. Zippy Acceleration The foil section is thin but with pronounced camber, decreasing drag while also improving lift, forward projection and acceleration. Consistent Pitch Linear pitch characteristics throughout the full speed range even out front and back foot pressure, minimising lift spikes during acceleration and deceleration on the wave. Broader Speed Range A high camber section delivers the perfect blend of lift at low speeds to make getting onto foil easy, yet retains excellent controllability at high speeds. Specifications: Area:&#160;235cm2 Span:&#160;386mm Aspect Ratio:&#160;6.4 Angle relative to fuselage:&#160;-1.5 deg.</description>

<title>North Sonar SF830 Front Wing</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=10439</link>
<description>
DESCRIPTION [Arrow icon] We&#8217;ve engineered our Sonar Surf Series for super low stall speeds, effortless pumping and surf-style carving. Ideal for riders wanting more from surf and downwind swells (with or without a wing). The foil&#8217;s insensitivity to angle of attack change means you don&#8217;t have&#160;to be an expert or have perfect pumping technique. A refined balance of roll stability and manoeuvrability gives you confidence during pumping and take-offs, and the ability to initiate powerful rail-to-rail carves. Push it harder, lip stall and lay down banking turns, knowing tip ventilation is a thing of the past. Reduced distance between the mast and front wing makes for faster, tighter pivoting turns. We&#8217;ve kept the span similar between the three sizes, providing the same ride feel across the entire size range. The SF promises a frictionless sensation of glide at slower speeds. Responsive and agile. With intuitive recovery. Wakesurfing ten waves back, prone-surfing, wing-surfing, pumping or mastering the downwind. The Sonar SF Series. At one, with it all.</description>

<title>North Sonar MA850v2 Front Wing</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=10438</link>
<description>
DESCRIPTION The MA850v2 Front Wing is a mid-aspect ratio wing ideal for lighter to average weight advanced wingfoilers or prone surfers, and kitefoilers. Very fast and extremely manoeuvrable, the airfoil section has been designed with more emphasis on top-speed over stall speed. The area&#160;and aspect ratio combination gives the MA850v2 excellent agility and efficient glide, provided speed is maintained. It retains a locked-in feel for upwind/powered riding.The MA850v2 is a fantastically versatile wing for an advanced rider looking for a wide speed range across multiple disciplines. Guaranteed ventilation-free tip-breaching, so you can really crank your turns.</description>

<title>North Sonar S215 Stabilizer</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=10437</link>
<description>
DESCRIPTION [Arrow icon] The S215 Surf stabilizer has a lower stall to complement the SF Front Wings. Its moderate span creates an aspect ratio high enough for efficient pumping, while remaining compact for responsiveness in turns?. The minimal sweep outline improves low-speed performance and effectively reduces&#160;fuselage length compared to swept stabilizers?. Tips curve upwards to provide directional stability, inspiring confidence during takeoffs and grip in turns. ?Advanced riders seeking a looser feel may choose to remove the wingtips, using the dashed guideline graphic, to create a completely flat stabilizer with a 205cm2 area.</description>

<title>North Sonar S208 Stabilizer</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=10436</link>
<description>
&#160; DESCRIPTION Flat, loose and fast, the new S208 Stabilizer is another high performance upgrade to the Sonar Foil System for experienced riders. The S208 has a higher aspect ratio than the S210, which means less drag, and the flatter rondure (front view) enables more&#160;manoeuvrability. As we&#8217;ve increased our front wing range, we&#8217;ve needed to match the lift force of the front wing with the stabilizer. While your front wing creates vertical lift, your stabilizer has a downward acting force, which prevents the front wing from nose-diving. A larger stabilizer translates into more front foot pressure, while a smaller stabilizer equals less front foot pressure. The North stabs are mounted on top of the fuselage, which helps them to avoid turbulence from the flow of the front wing, creating a smoother ride. This top mounting also gives the rider an early breach warning - the stab pierces the water surface first, giving you a better chance of recovery before your front wing gets too high. Like the Front Wings, all Sonar Stabilizers are pre-preg carbon construction, ensuring optimal stiffness and direct performance. The thin profile section reduces drag, while the material properties help maintain structural integrity and rigidity. Stabs have a huge influence on performance. As you progress to smaller wing sizes, we recommend changing to a smaller stabilizer to be more manoeuvrable. Experienced riders will really feel the difference. A new tail can have a big impact on your style</description>

<title>North Sonar SF1080 Front Wing</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=10435</link>
<description>
DESCRIPTION We&#8217;ve engineered our Sonar Surf Series for super low stall speeds, effortless pumping and surf-style carving. Ideal for riders wanting more from surf and downwind swells (with or without a wing). The foils insensitivity to angle of attack change forgiveness means you don&#8217;t&#160;have to be an expert or have perfect pumping technique. A refined balance of roll stability and manoeuvrability gives you confidence during pumping and take-offs, and the ability to initiate powerful rail-to-rail carves. Push it harder, lip stall and lay down banking turns, knowing tip ventilation is a thing of the past. Reduced distance between the mast and front wing makes for faster, tighter pivoting turns. We&#8217;ve kept the span similar between the three sizes, providing the same ride feel across the entire size range. The SF promises that frictionless sensation of glide at slower speeds. Responsive and agile. With intuitive recovery. Wakesurfing ten waves back, prone-surfing, wing-surfing, pumping or mastering the downwind. The Sonar SF Series. At one, with it all</description>

Go-Joe The Go-Joe is in use in schools world wide and is the only board recovery device officially endorsed and promoted by both the IKO and PASA, the world&#8217;s two largest kiteboard instructor certification bodies. &#160; Designed to sit unobtrusively between your feet on the board, you won&#8217;t even notice the Go-Joe when riding. However, lose your board and the Go-Joe&#8217;s inflated body will flip your board over for you and catch the wind, sailing the board down wind so that it is never far from you after a crash or hard landing.</description>

<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=8209</link>
<description>
New super flexy material delivers an extra durable better fitting kiteboard pump hose. Standard on the new WMFG Pump 2.0T this new hose is available as an upgrade for Pump 1.0T and 1.0R. Only available with threaded hose fitting for WMFG pumps (does not fit other brands of kite pumps).&#160; This hose will offer an upgraded fit and is more durable than standard kiteboard hoses. To prevent possible kinks WMFG recommends removing the hose between uses and during transport. If you get in a bind you can cut the end of the hose and reattach it.</description>

<title>North Sonar AF Board Adaptor</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=10384</link>
<description>
DESCRIPTION [Arrow icon] The Sonar Foil System is connected to the board by a lightweight CNC-machined aluminium Board Adaptor with a tapered geometry locking connection that engages with the mast, fusing Board Adaptor and mast together to build one union for optimum load transfer and a&#160;stronger, more direct feeling and steering impulse when foiling. FE-Analysis allows us to increase strength in the areas of highest stress concentration and reduce unecessary weight in lower stress areas. Incorporates a strong geometry locking connection for better energy transfer and a more direct feel.</description>

<title>2022 Armstrong HA 195 Tail Wing A+</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=9264</link>
<description>
THE NEW HA195 TAIL WING IS SLEEK, ELEGANT, AND FAST! IT&#8217;S BEEN DESIGNED TO UNLOCK EVERY DROP OF PERFORMANCE AND HANDLING POTENTIAL FROM OUR HA FRONT WINGS. This new design is cutting edge in terms of aspect ratio, thickness and anhedral. Combined with our HA wings the result is a smoother faster flowing ride with more speed, glide and precise handling! This effectively further increases the already outstanding performance and manoeuvrability of the HA foils. The feedback from our team riders has been solid, plenty of frothing over the feel and performance increase the HA195 delivers. The HA195 pairs perfectly with our HA foils but also improves top end performance of the CF and HS foil range too. Construction The tail wing has a foam core wrapped in the highest quality Carbon keeping it light and super rigid. The Titanium screw inserts are in keeping with our philosophy of zero corrosion materials throughout the entire product range. The unique flow fences improve stability by minimizing the disruption of turbulent flow from the front wing, mast and fuselage.

<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=10096</link>
<description>
PERFORMANCE, SPEED AND GLIDE HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO THE NEXT LEVEL WITH OUR HIGH ASPECT RANGE.&#160; At 10.2 it&#8217;s a true Hight Aspect ratio foil Foil that sets the standard for glide performance, while retaining enough handling that it can be turned easily, taking your ride to the next level.&#160; The HA1325 is truly amazing, the turn radius and pitch stability are sublime! Sleek inflected tips help prevent ventilation even if the tip breaches. Next level pump and glide if you want to double dip or link up micro swells, this Foil just keeps on going!&#160; For experienced wingers there is no comparison, it makes tacking so&#160;fun and easy as the speed and glide gives you so much time to complete manoeuvres. Combine this with amazing upwind angles, freakish light wind performance and the riding never stops! Developed with key design input from Pete Burling, Helmsman of Team New Zealand&#8217;s Americas Cup yacht (Current AC holders) and tested by legendary Sailor Jimmy Spithill.&#160; Pete, Armie and Jimmy became friends as foiling united their search and passion for ultimate performance and glide on downwind runs. The mad scientist and these high-performance sailing gurus have collaborated to create something the likes of which has not been seen before outside the Americas Cup!&#160; Construction Construction is based around a high-density foam core, which is wrapped with 100% IM and High Modulus Carbon.&#160; The main Foils are shaped and refined for maximum stability and predictability at all speeds The foil sections have been carefully designed by one of the world&#8217;s foremost sport Foil designers.

<description>
Infos &amp; Characteristics &#160; The &#171; Wing Paddle Attachments &#187; can be velcroed around the wing&#8217;s center strut. They allow for any paddle to be fixed along the center strut, enabling for comfortable&#160;&#8220;deflaters&#8221;. The paddle goes unnoticed, which makes the upwind phase much easier&#160;and more comfortable. &#160; Once upwind, it is easy to release the paddle and deflate your wing, while the Paddle Attachments stay fixed to the strut.</description>

<title>Kite Pump Adapter for Duotone</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=9078</link>
<description>
The PKS North/Duotone Airport&#160; Pump Adapter/Nozzle with double silicone sealing ring is compatible with 2013 and newer North kites, and 2014 and newer Cabrinha kites with the Airlock 2 screw valve. This adapter was built to fit newer model heavy duty pump hoses (2016 and newer.)&#160; The adapter does also fit older model pump hoses (prior to 2016) very tightly but does not lock in like standard OEM adapters.&#160; The adapter can be used as is or may need to be modified by filing down the tiny nub near the ridge of the adapter where it connects to the hose. If you remove the Silicone sealing Rrings, this works perfectly in Core kites as well.</description>

<title>Kite Pump Adapter for Duotone</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=9078</link>
<description>
The PKS North/Duotone Airport&#160; Pump Adapter/Nozzle with double silicone sealing ring is compatible with 2013 and newer North kites, and 2014 and newer Cabrinha kites with the Airlock 2 screw valve. This adapter was built to fit newer model heavy duty pump hoses (2016 and newer.)&#160; The adapter does also fit older model pump hoses (prior to 2016) very tightly but does not lock in like standard OEM adapters.&#160; The adapter can be used as is or may need to be modified by filing down the tiny nub near the ridge of the adapter where it connects to the hose. If you remove the Silicone sealing Rrings, this works perfectly in Core kites as well.</description>

<title>Armstrong HA1525 Foil Kit</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=10098</link>
<description>
THE HA1525 BRINGS THE RENOWNED GLIDE AND SPEED OF THE HIGH ASPECT RANGE TO RIDERS OVER 86KG (190LBS). We&#8217;ve found that this foil&#8217;s excellent low end ability makes lightwind cruising and tacking a breeze. Looking to link up endless bumps down the coast? The HA1525&#8217;s impressive speed and glide performance caters perfectly to advanced riders of all weights looking to maximise downwinders and flatwater pumping.&#160; Effortless Glide In our quest to create an inspiring range of High Aspect foils, we honed a design that emphasizes glide and speed. With this DNA, the HA1525 offers amazing top speed for its size and exciting performance for everything from the afternoon soul session to dialing in those tacks.&#160; Elegant and Smooth Breathtaking curves and flowing lines are the HA signature. With a drawn out aspect ratio (AR) of 9.5 and wingspan of 1200mm, we think the HA1525 will set new flatwater pumping records limited only by your legs.&#160; Precision Fabrication Through meticulous attention to detail, we&#8217;ve given the HA range a truly premium layup. A high-density foam core is wrapped with intermediate and high modulus carbon fiber to keep things light and provide incredible flex response.&#160; Inspired Design To craft the best foil possible, we looked to those with unparalleled foiling knowledge. Sailing gurus and America&#8217;s Cup legends Pete Burling and Jimmy Spithill were integral in helping to develop the HA range, transmitting a piece of their history into your session. Features and Recommendations Ideal for lightwind winging, advanced riders 86kg (190lbs) and up. Excellent for downwinding in light to moderate conditions, advanced riders. Pair with HA195 stabilizer to unlock greater glide and looseness. Pair with 70cm fuselage to increase stability and pumping. Dimensions: Area:&#160;1525 cm2 Wingspan:&#160;1200 mm Foil weight:&#160;1275 grams Aspect Ratio:&#160;9.5 *Kit comes complete with - Carry case, Polycarbonate Pro Shims, Bi Directional Titanium Washers, Titanium T-nuts,&#160;Screws, Torx tool, Protective mast and Foil covers.

<description>
THE HA1525 BRINGS THE RENOWNED GLIDE AND SPEED OF THE HIGH ASPECT RANGE TO RIDERS OVER 86KG (190LBS). We&#8217;ve found that this foil&#8217;s excellent low end ability makes lightwind cruising and tacking a breeze. Looking to link up endless bumps down the coast? The HA1525&#8217;s impressive speed and glide performance caters perfectly to advanced riders of all weights looking to maximise downwinders and flatwater pumping.&#160; Effortless Glide In our quest to create an inspiring range of High Aspect foils, we honed a design that emphasizes glide and speed. With this DNA, the HA1525 offers amazing top speed for its size and exciting performance for everything from the afternoon soul session to dialing in those tacks.&#160; Elegant and Smooth Breathtaking curves and flowing lines are the HA signature. With a drawn out aspect ratio (AR) of 9.5 and wingspan of 1200mm, we think the HA1525 will set new flatwater pumping records limited only by your legs.&#160; Precision Fabrication Through meticulous attention to detail, we&#8217;ve given the HA range a truly premium layup. A high-density foam core is wrapped with intermediate and high modulus carbon fiber to keep things light and provide incredible flex response.&#160; Inspired Design To craft the best foil possible, we looked to those with unparalleled foiling knowledge. Sailing gurus and America&#8217;s Cup legends Pete Burling and Jimmy Spithill were integral in helping to develop the HA range, transmitting a piece of their history into your session.

<title>Core Spectrum Rear Wing Stabilizer</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=9882</link>
<description>
CORE SPECTRUM STABILIZER SMALL WING, LARGE IMPACT Even, predictable flight. Easy, steady takeoffs. And super smooth turns. The larger size imparts a more balanced flight behavior at all speeds. The dihedral curvature lets you tilt the foil into turns like a skateboard for a smoother cruising behavior. Gybes, tacks, 360s, and transitions are much easier since you can feel your back wing and use it to pivot the foil.&#160; A high-quality lightweight carbon and PU foam construction is more complex to build than a pure carbon wing but the weight savings is worth it.</description>

<description>
Core Spectrum Mastbase THE FINAL TOUCH Lightweight, 90mm mast track compatible and has a hydrodynamic profile that delivers an unmatched connection to your board. The deep mast socket provides a tight, secure connection with your foil. The low profile and slick form minimize resistance during touchdowns. We kept the base as lightweight as possible while adding strategic internal struts to absorb stress from the mast stringers. We also opened the screw attachment points for quicker assembly.</description>

HA 1125... TAKING PERFORMANCE, SPEED AND GLIDE TO THE NEXT LEVEL! Performance, speed and glide have been taken to the next level with the High Aspect 1125. It was developed with key design input from Pete Burling, helmsman of Team New Zealand&#8217;s Americas Cup yacht (Current AC holders) and tested by legendary sailor, Jimmy Spithill. Pete, Jimmy and Armie became friends as foiling united their search and passion for ultimate performance and glide on downwind runs. The mad scientist and these high-performance sailing gurus have collaborated to create something the likes of which has not seen before outside the Americas Cup! At 9.8:1 it&#8217;s a true High Aspect ratio foil that sets the standard for glide performance, while retaining enough handling that it can be turned easily, making for an exhilarating ride. Downwind aficionados requiring max glide performance will want to get their hands on this Foil simply because it is next level! In small surf on an 85cm mast or longer, the HA1125 can be ridden to good effect, the turning radius is surprisingly good for is high aspect ratio. The sleek, inflected tips help prevent ventilation even if a tip breaches. It&#8217;s next level pump and glide make it easy to double dip! For experienced wingers there is no comparison. It makes tacking fun and easy as the glide gives you so much time to complete maneuvers like 360&#8217;s. Combine this with amazing upwind angles and outrageous downwind glide, as well as freakish light wind performance and the riding it just never stops! Construction Construction is based around a high-density foam core, which is wrapped with 100% IM and High Modulus Carbon.&#160; The main&#160;Foils are shaped and refined for maximum stability and predictability at all speeds The foil sections have been carefully designed by one of the world&#8217;s foremost sport Foil designers.

Incredible Wind Range Light wind specific Huge wind range, 6-20 knots Tight radius turn for great pop and fun Easy to fly and re-launch even in light winds It&#8217;s incredible wind range allows you to continue riding when the wind increases, this unique attribute sets it apart from competitors. New Rip-stop Material Combination The Zephyr V7 features our new rip-stop material combination. The new rip-stop canopy material has an advanced ultra flex coating improving feedback in gustier conditions making for a smoother ride. The new technical rip-stop dacron is super tough, used on the Leading Edge and Struts it improves strength, durability and longevity. More Fun in Light Winds Having the power of a 17m kite on demand with the feedback of a 13m translates to more fun in light winds. The incredibly nimble handling with a tight radius turn, ease of use and the ability to have fun in low winds characterises the Zephyr. It is perfect for cruising, jumping, air style, honing strapless airs or learning handle passes. The boost is impressive and floaty, with instant power delivery and superior up-wind performance. All-round One-Kite Quiver The Zephyr V7 is the perfect accomplice for when the wind is looking light or unstable, it will get you out enjoying the conditions for any length of time whatever the style you choose to ride. Or if you mainly ride in light wind spots and are looking for an all-round one-kite quiver, this is the kite for you. An all new Fast Flow One-Pump An all new Fast Flow One-Pump Inflation System makes set up and packing quick and easy. It features single point inflation/deflation and a high air flow rate between the Struts and Leading Edge, with clips to seal the hoses to prevent unwanted air flow in case of damage.&#160; Re-launch is surprisingly quick and easy considering its size, simply by turning the bar or using the Re-launch Balls on the leader lines the kite smoothly lifts off the water ready for more action. Exceptional Ozone Factory Construction World-class construction in our own factory, using the highest quality materials and hand checked Quality Control at every step. The Ozone factory also manufactures our Paragliding and Speed Wing range; the same Quality Control processes are used across all products. Designed With OZ-CAD The FUTURE is NOW - All Ozone kites and wings are designed and developed using our own highly advanced custom built CAD software. Our designers are able to work with features specifically tailored to the unique forms and structures of technical inflatable and foil kites and wings. Part of our design team is dedicated to the upgrade of the CAD code and addition of new modules and features to the program as the development of our products continues. 4-line Pulley-less System NO pulleys, NO problems. We design all our inflatable kites without pulleys, to inherit the unique Ozone feeling and performance across our range. All New Ripstop Material Combination The new rip-stop canopy material has an advanced ultra flex coating improving feedback in gustier conditions making for a smoother ride. The new technical rip-stop dacron is super tough, used on the Leading Edge and Struts it improves strength, durability and longevity Internal reinforcements What&#8217;s on the inside counts too &#8211; internal reinforcements for improved strength and durability; such as a Double layered Dacron + Insignia taped Leading Edge closing seam with high strength threads. Double Stitched Folded Seams Sail canopy seams are stitched, folded, and then stitched again for a clean and strong connection of the panels. Load Distribution Panels Dacron reinforcements are used on all loaded areas for enhanced load distribution. This means all loads are spread evenly into the sail ensuring the kite flies and performs at its best. Direct Connect Struts Our Direct Connect construction method improves load distribution between the Leading Edge, Struts and Canopy. Struts are connected directly to the Leading Edge with internal and external reinforcements. This unique construction method ensures clean profiles are maintained with the optimum canopy tension. Reinforced Leading Edge and Struts The Leading Edge and Struts are reinforced in high stress areas to ensure the kite canopy remains in shape and performs at its best. Reinforced Trailing Edge Double layer Trailing Edge strip with an internal light weight Dyneema reinforcement &#8211; this reduces canopy wear and helps to maintain optimum Trailing Edge tension as designed. The Dyneema line also reduces any potential stretch at the Trailing Edge. Low profile aerodynamic Scuff Pads Leading Edge bumpers are often large and unnecessary cosmetic items. At Ozone we build our kites and wings for performance and durability using the best materials &amp; components available. Any areas requiring scuff protection we use a lightweight durable material with superior abrasion resistance, while keeping a low profile in order to reduce drag and maintain performance. Unique bladder construction Our bladders are constructed in-house with advanced custom built welding machines. Double layered sections are applied to any potential wear areas. Anti-Snag line deflectors The Anti-Snag line deflectors prevent bridles and lines from tangling around the wing tip. Safety is increased when launching with a partner and water re-launch is made easier. Fast Flow One-Pump Inflation System The Fast Flow One-Pump Inflation System makes set up and packing quick and easy. It features single point inflation/deflation and a high air flow rate between the Struts and Leading Edge, with clips to seal the hoses to prevent unwanted air flow in case of damage. Back-line trimming options Customise your handling and bar pressure with the back line bridle attachments. Closer to the Leading Edge for slower turn speed and more bar pressure, or closer to the Trailing Edge for faster turn speed and less bar pressure. Fool proof line connectors Fool proof line connectors prevent incorrect rigging of the flying lines to the kite.

HA 1125... TAKING PERFORMANCE, SPEED AND GLIDE TO THE NEXT LEVEL! Performance, speed and glide have been taken to the next level with the High Aspect 1125. It was developed with key design input from Pete Burling, helmsman of Team New Zealand&#8217;s Americas Cup yacht (Current AC holders) and tested by legendary sailor, Jimmy Spithill. Pete, Jimmy and Armie became friends as foiling united their search and passion for ultimate performance and glide on downwind runs. The mad scientist and these high-performance sailing gurus have collaborated to create something the likes of which has not seen before outside the Americas Cup! At 9.8:1 it&#8217;s a true High Aspect ratio foil that sets the standard for glide performance, while retaining enough handling that it can be turned easily, making for an exhilarating ride. Downwind aficionados requiring max glide performance will want to get their hands on this Foil simply because it is next level! In small surf on an 85cm mast or longer, the HA1125 can be ridden to good effect, the turning radius is surprisingly good for is high aspect ratio. The sleek, inflected tips help prevent ventilation even if a tip breaches. It&#8217;s next level pump and glide make it easy to double dip! For experienced wingers there is no comparison. It makes tacking fun and easy as the glide gives you so much time to complete maneuvers like 360&#8217;s. Combine this with amazing upwind angles and outrageous downwind glide, as well as freakish light wind performance and the riding it just never stops! Construction Construction is based around a high-density foam core, which is wrapped with 100% IM and High Modulus Carbon.&#160; The main&#160;Foils are shaped and refined for maximum stability and predictability at all speeds The foil sections have been carefully designed by one of the world&#8217;s foremost sport Foil designers.

Incredible Wind Range Light wind specific Huge wind range, 6-20 knots Tight radius turn for great pop and fun Easy to fly and re-launch even in light winds It&#8217;s incredible wind range allows you to continue riding when the wind increases, this unique attribute sets it apart from competitors. New Rip-stop Material Combination The Zephyr V7 features our new rip-stop material combination. The new rip-stop canopy material has an advanced ultra flex coating improving feedback in gustier conditions making for a smoother ride. The new technical rip-stop dacron is super tough, used on the Leading Edge and Struts it improves strength, durability and longevity. More Fun in Light Winds Having the power of a 17m kite on demand with the feedback of a 13m translates to more fun in light winds. The incredibly nimble handling with a tight radius turn, ease of use and the ability to have fun in low winds characterises the Zephyr. It is perfect for cruising, jumping, air style, honing strapless airs or learning handle passes. The boost is impressive and floaty, with instant power delivery and superior up-wind performance. All-round One-Kite Quiver The Zephyr V7 is the perfect accomplice for when the wind is looking light or unstable, it will get you out enjoying the conditions for any length of time whatever the style you choose to ride. Or if you mainly ride in light wind spots and are looking for an all-round one-kite quiver, this is the kite for you. An all new Fast Flow One-Pump An all new Fast Flow One-Pump Inflation System makes set up and packing quick and easy. It features single point inflation/deflation and a high air flow rate between the Struts and Leading Edge, with clips to seal the hoses to prevent unwanted air flow in case of damage.&#160; Re-launch is surprisingly quick and easy considering its size, simply by turning the bar or using the Re-launch Balls on the leader lines the kite smoothly lifts off the water ready for more action. Exceptional Ozone Factory Construction World-class construction in our own factory, using the highest quality materials and hand checked Quality Control at every step. The Ozone factory also manufactures our Paragliding and Speed Wing range; the same Quality Control processes are used across all products. Designed With OZ-CAD The FUTURE is NOW - All Ozone kites and wings are designed and developed using our own highly advanced custom built CAD software. Our designers are able to work with features specifically tailored to the unique forms and structures of technical inflatable and foil kites and wings. Part of our design team is dedicated to the upgrade of the CAD code and addition of new modules and features to the program as the development of our products continues. 4-line Pulley-less System NO pulleys, NO problems. We design all our inflatable kites without pulleys, to inherit the unique Ozone feeling and performance across our range. All New Ripstop Material Combination The new rip-stop canopy material has an advanced ultra flex coating improving feedback in gustier conditions making for a smoother ride. The new technical rip-stop dacron is super tough, used on the Leading Edge and Struts it improves strength, durability and longevity Internal reinforcements What&#8217;s on the inside counts too &#8211; internal reinforcements for improved strength and durability; such as a Double layered Dacron + Insignia taped Leading Edge closing seam with high strength threads. Double Stitched Folded Seams Sail canopy seams are stitched, folded, and then stitched again for a clean and strong connection of the panels. Load Distribution Panels Dacron reinforcements are used on all loaded areas for enhanced load distribution. This means all loads are spread evenly into the sail ensuring the kite flies and performs at its best. Direct Connect Struts Our Direct Connect construction method improves load distribution between the Leading Edge, Struts and Canopy. Struts are connected directly to the Leading Edge with internal and external reinforcements. This unique construction method ensures clean profiles are maintained with the optimum canopy tension. Reinforced Leading Edge and Struts The Leading Edge and Struts are reinforced in high stress areas to ensure the kite canopy remains in shape and performs at its best. Reinforced Trailing Edge Double layer Trailing Edge strip with an internal light weight Dyneema reinforcement &#8211; this reduces canopy wear and helps to maintain optimum Trailing Edge tension as designed. The Dyneema line also reduces any potential stretch at the Trailing Edge. Low profile aerodynamic Scuff Pads Leading Edge bumpers are often large and unnecessary cosmetic items. At Ozone we build our kites and wings for performance and durability using the best materials &amp; components available. Any areas requiring scuff protection we use a lightweight durable material with superior abrasion resistance, while keeping a low profile in order to reduce drag and maintain performance. Unique bladder construction Our bladders are constructed in-house with advanced custom built welding machines. Double layered sections are applied to any potential wear areas. Anti-Snag line deflectors The Anti-Snag line deflectors prevent bridles and lines from tangling around the wing tip. Safety is increased when launching with a partner and water re-launch is made easier. Fast Flow One-Pump Inflation System The Fast Flow One-Pump Inflation System makes set up and packing quick and easy. It features single point inflation/deflation and a high air flow rate between the Struts and Leading Edge, with clips to seal the hoses to prevent unwanted air flow in case of damage. Back-line trimming options Customise your handling and bar pressure with the back line bridle attachments. Closer to the Leading Edge for slower turn speed and more bar pressure, or closer to the Trailing Edge for faster turn speed and less bar pressure. Fool proof line connectors Fool proof line connectors prevent incorrect rigging of the flying lines to the kite.

<title>Ride Engine Air Box Electric Pump</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=10202</link>
<description>
The technology evolution for kites, wings, and boards has rapidly improved to enhance your experience on the water. However, perhaps the most critical component required to get on the water -the pump- has remained unchanged since the days of flip phones. Not anymore. Gone are the times of struggling with manual pumping, thanks to the Air Box: Ride Engine&#39;s rechargeable electric pump. Engineered alongside a top electric pump manufacturer, the Air Box has a powerful two-stage system that automatically switches from low-pressure, high-volume pumping to high-pressure, low-volume delivering the fastest inflation possible. Eliminate the worry of over or under inflating your gear when you set your desired air pressure on the Air Box. The smart inflation technology has real-time pressure monitoring, ensuring an automatic shut-off once the pump reaches the selected pressure. Powered by a lithium-ion battery cell, it can inflate four to six kites or wings, and three SUPs on a single charge. SIZE: 162mm x 162mm x 85mm 11.1V.&#160;&#160;&#160; 4000mAh.&#160;&#160;&#160; 44.4Wh. INCLUDES:&#160;Air Box, Hose (3&#39;), 4 Nozzles, USB-C Charging Cable, 12V Car Charger</description>

<title>Dakine Foil Board Straight Floating Leash</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=9861</link>
<description>
These hollow leashes are perfect for foil surfing or wing foiling. These leashes float, which prevents them from getting caught around the foil. It also comes with three movable EVA floats to keep the end of the leash from sinking and getting wrapped on the foil. These leashes are good up to 8&#39; swell and feature a removable neoprene cuff. Replace the cuff with the Dura-cord line, and it attaches perfectly to our wing waist leash. It comes in 7&#39; Strait and 7&#39; coil options.&#160;</description>

NITRO ULTRA-RESPONSIVE, ULTRA-LIGHT, ULTRA-DURABLE The immediate responsiveness makes the Nitro feel like it has half a square meter more power. Starting at well under 1.5 kg, the ultra-lightweight is something you feel instantly. The extra stiff struts create control and a wider wind range, so you can enjoy the wing in more wind conditions. The key to the Nitro is the new Ho&#8217;okipa Ultra PE high pressure leading edge and strut, with our proven Ultra PE load frame. Airush and Starboard have a combined 50 years of chasing responsiveness, lightweight and durability. Today, the FreeWing Nitro is the best example of this yet. &#160; &#160;</description>

NITRO ULTRA-RESPONSIVE, ULTRA-LIGHT, ULTRA-DURABLE The immediate responsiveness makes the Nitro feel like it has half a square meter more power. Starting at well under 1.5 kg, the ultra-lightweight is something you feel instantly. The extra stiff struts create control and a wider wind range, so you can enjoy the wing in more wind conditions. The key to the Nitro is the new Ho&#8217;okipa Ultra PE high pressure leading edge and strut, with our proven Ultra PE load frame. Airush and Starboard have a combined 50 years of chasing responsiveness, lightweight and durability. Today, the FreeWing Nitro is the best example of this yet. &#160; &#160;</description>

This is the wrist&#160;leash for wing boarding. It is a highly adjustable way to connect the rider to the wing. Although this is an Ozone product, it is compatable with other brands like Cabrinha, F-One and Duotone. With the wrist&#160;leash you also need to purchase a leash line, which comes in three different sizes:&#160;2.3m, 3m and 4m, and 5m and 6m. Each size cooresponds to the size of the wing you are using.</description>

Sizes: 7 / 8 / 9 / 10 / 11 / 12 / 14 Experience the absolute refinement of this newest edition of the BANDIT to ever offer its legendary precision feel and increase the overall comfort. With an extensive work on smoothing out the entire profile, the BANDIT XVI offers sharper performances and more stability and efficiency than ever before.&#160; Smooth profile and controlled deformation for incredible efficiency Impressive stability no matter the conditions Absolute control at all time Amazing responsiveness for epic sensations Precision flying with an excellent range Effortless upwind abilities Features FLAT SEWING&#160; Stronger assembly of the panels: they are now glued and sewn together to make the canopy more rip resistant.&#160; STREAMLINED LEADING EDGE END TIPS The leading edge tips benefit from a reduced diameter, they are streamlined to lower the drag and equipped with a strap to avoid bridle tangling VERTICAL STRUT CUT The kite&#39;s struts are designed with a vertical cut in order to optimize the strength / diameter ratio. KEVLAR&#174; REINFORCEMENT ON LEADING EDGE&#160; Most seams on the leading edge are protected with an abrasion-resistant Kevlar&#174; fabric to prevent the seams from deteriorating when the kite&#39;s profile is subjected to aggressive ground friction ONE PUMP COLLAR VALVE Easier to remove and put back. Convenient for bladder replacement. SPIDER BRIDLE The Spider Bridle is a multi-point of connection well dispatched along the leading edge which offers a better control of the arc of the kite during the flight. The stability in all wind conditions is very impressive and pushes the high wind range to incredible limits. CNC&#39;D PULLEY The&#160;new, CNC-shaped, anodized aluminum low friction &#171;pulleys&#8221;&#160;are super lightweight and increase the kite&#8217;s reactivity. They&#160;also raise the bridle&#8217;s resistance to abrasion and its overall&#160;durability. &#160;</description>

NITRO ULTRA-RESPONSIVE, ULTRA-LIGHT, ULTRA-DURABLE The immediate responsiveness makes the Nitro feel like it has half a square meter more power. Starting at well under 1.5 kg, the ultra-lightweight is something you feel instantly. The extra stiff struts create control and a wider wind range, so you can enjoy the wing in more wind conditions. The key to the Nitro is the new Ho&#8217;okipa Ultra PE high pressure leading edge and strut, with our proven Ultra PE load frame. Airush and Starboard have a combined 50 years of chasing responsiveness, lightweight and durability. Today, the FreeWing Nitro is the best example of this yet. &#160; &#160;</description>

SHIPS OUT THURSDAY 1.26!! &#160; BANDIT XVI The legend, redefined. Sizes: 7 / 8 / 9 / 10 / 11 / 12 / 14 Experience the absolute refinement of this newest edition of the BANDIT to ever offer its legendary precision feel and increase the overall comfort. With an extensive work on smoothing out the entire profile, the BANDIT XVI offers sharper performances and more stability and efficiency than ever before.&#160; Smooth profile and controlled deformation for incredible efficiency Impressive stability no matter the conditions Absolute control at all time Amazing responsiveness for epic sensations Precision flying with an excellent range Effortless upwind abilities Features FLAT SEWING&#160; Stronger assembly of the panels: they are now glued and sewn together to make the canopy more rip resistant.&#160; STREAMLINED LEADING EDGE END TIPS The leading edge tips benefit from a reduced diameter, they are streamlined to lower the drag and equipped with a strap to avoid bridle tangling VERTICAL STRUT CUT The kite&#39;s struts are designed with a vertical cut in order to optimize the strength / diameter ratio. KEVLAR&#174; REINFORCEMENT ON LEADING EDGE&#160; Most seams on the leading edge are protected with an abrasion-resistant Kevlar&#174; fabric to prevent the seams from deteriorating when the kite&#39;s profile is subjected to aggressive ground friction ONE PUMP COLLAR VALVE Easier to remove and put back. Convenient for bladder replacement. SPIDER BRIDLE The Spider Bridle is a multi-point of connection well dispatched along the leading edge which offers a better control of the arc of the kite during the flight. The stability in all wind conditions is very impressive and pushes the high wind range to incredible limits. CNC&#39;D PULLEY The&#160;new, CNC-shaped, anodized aluminum low friction &#171;pulleys&#8221;&#160;are super lightweight and increase the kite&#8217;s reactivity. They&#160;also raise the bridle&#8217;s resistance to abrasion and its overall&#160;durability. &#160;</description>

<title>Core Sensor 3 Pro Foil Control Bar</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=9423</link>
<description>
For the ultimate XLITE experience, select the highly specialized Sensor 3 Pro Foil bar. It&#39;s narrower width (45cm/41.5cm), and super thin lines reduce air resistance and improve steering.

We also include an additional 3m line extension so you can ride 25m lines if you should choose. Sensor 3 Pro Foil bar (45cm/41,5cm) 22m Tectanium Vario Lite lines (16+4+2m) Standard loop/stick set with assembled triple ring. Combo ring included in delivery.</description>

Heck, even water starts in light winds are easier. The bar comes standard with 22-meter long Tectanium Vario Lite lines (16+4+2m) that have a breaking load of over 300 kilograms. We also include an additional 3m line extension so you can ride 25m lines if you should choose. Sensor 3 Pro Foil bar (45cm/41,5cm) 22m Tectanium Vario Lite lines (16+4+2m) Standard loop/stick set with assembled triple ring. Combo ring included in delivery.</description>

Info &amp; Characteristics The HAAPITI&#8217;s got style but doesn&#8217;t sacrifice on technique. It uses a performing 4 Way stretch fabric and the material repels water like a charm. Good to be worn both in and out of the water. For our new collection, the HAAPITI is back with a slightly shorter cut and a bit narrower fit. We use a PFOA/PFOS-free durable water repellent, as these chemicals are very persistent and harmful to the environment once released in the ocean. - MID LEG 18&quot; -</description>

Good to be worn both in and out of the water. For our new collection, the HAAPITI is back with a slightly shorter cut and a bit narrower fit. We use a PFOA/PFOS-free durable water repellent, as these chemicals are very persistent and harmful to the environment once released in the ocean. - MID LEG 18&quot; -</description>

Info &amp; Characteristics Our bamboo Poncho has been considered the best for quite a while now. We did not make any compromise during its conception and used 550gsm high-quality fabric only. We now offer a 30 percent lighter alternative for summer or for traveling, so we have designed the Summer Poncho with the same bamboo fabric in 380gsm. We chose bamboo fabric for mainly two reasons: The Bamboo material has many great characteristics: Ultra soft feeling Absorbs water three to four times better than a regular cotton Dries twice as fast as other materials Naturally bacteriostatic Naturally hypo-allergenic And a reduced impact on earth Grows without fertilizers and pesticides Bamboo farming needs four times less water than cotton Absorbs 30% more CO2 than a tree, creates 30% more oxygen Prevents deforestation: Can grow 1 meter per day Prevents erosion because of its long roots</description>

Product Information Ozone Enduro V4 2023 Freeride Kite Performance freeride kite for intermediate to experienced riders The&#160;Ozone Enduro V4&#160;is made to give you an amazing performance, in all conditions. Whether you like freeride, wave/foil or even occasionally want to unhook or kiteloop, with the Ozone Enduro V4 it is all possible! The Enduro V4 has been completely redesigned using Ozone&#39;s latest construction technology and design software features. As a result, ozone has taken the performance of the Enduro to a higher level. The Enduro has been one of the most popular all-round kites on the market for years for every style and all conditions. This year, the brand is introducing a new Continuous Curve Leading Edge construction and Transverse Sail Shaping. Each leading edge segment is now curved, creating a perfectly formed arc from point to point and resulting in a very smooth character in all conditions. The Ozone Enduro V4 2023 is equipped with Teijin TechnoForce Triple Ripstop canopy, which ensures a very strong construction. Thanks to the 4-line pulley-less system, the kite has a very direct steering behavior, but also a very good depower and relaunch. The Enduro V4 has a very large wind range and feels stable, even in very strong wind gusts. Kiteloops are a breeze with the new Ozone Enduro V4 as it spins easily on its axis and then climbs straight up. &#160; Specifications Ozone Enduro V4 2023 Exceptional Ozone Factory Construction Teijin TechnoForce Triple Ripstop canopy Teijin Triple Ripstop dacron Continuous curve Leading Edge 4-line pulleyless system Internal reinforcements Overlapping flat seams Direct connect struts Reinforced leading edge and struts Reinforced trailing edge Aerodynamic Low Profile Scuff Pads Unique bladder construction Aligned bridle geometry Fast-flowing inflation system with one pump Anti-flap soft battens Back-line trim options Foolproof line connectors Technical bag</description>

<description>
Includes: HA1125 Foil Kit with FV200 tail, 85cm Plate Mast, TC60 Fuselage and PP Shims Our new A+ System is taking strength and durability into the future! See this link for full details.&#160; DOWNWIND AFICIONADOS REQUIRING MAX GLIDE PERFORMANCE WILL WANT TO GET THEIR HANDS ON THIS WING SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS NEXT LEVEL! In small surf on an 85cm mast or longer, the HS1125 can be ridden to good effect, the turning radius is surprisingly good for is high aspect ratio. The sleek, inflected tips help prevent ventilation even if a tip breaches. It&#8217;s next level pump and glide make it easy to double dip! For experienced wingers there is no comparison. It makes tacking fun and easy as the glide gives you so much time to complete maneuvers like 360&#8217;s. Combine this with amazing upwind angles and outrageous downwind glide, as well as freakish light wind performance and the riding it just never stops. Dimensions Area: 1125 cm2 Wingspan: 1050 mm Weight: 3250g Aspect Ratio: 9.8 We recommend the setup below, much depends on rider weight, ability and chosen foil sports.&#160; Wing: HA1125&#160; Mast: M85cm/33.5&#8221; Fuselage: TC60 Tail Wing: HA195 *Kit comes complete with - Carry case, Polycarbonate Pro Shims, Bi Directional Titanium Washers, Titanium T-nuts, Screws, Torx tool, Protective mast and wing covers.</description>

<title>Armstrong HA 1525 Foil Kit</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=9429</link>
<description>
THE HA1525 BRINGS THE RENOWNED GLIDE AND SPEED OF THE HIGH ASPECT RANGE TO RIDERS OVER 86KG (190LBS). We&#8217;ve found that this foil&#8217;s excellent low end ability makes lightwind cruising and tacking a breeze. Looking to link up endless bumps down the coast? The HA1525&#8217;s impressive speed and glide performance caters perfectly to advanced riders of all weights looking to maximise downwinders and flatwater pumping.&#160; Effortless Glide In our quest to create an inspiring range of High Aspect foils, we honed a design that emphasizes glide and speed. With this DNA, the HA1525 offers amazing top speed for its size and exciting performance for everything from the afternoon soul session to dialing in those tacks.&#160; Elegant and Smooth Breathtaking curves and flowing lines are the HA signature. With a drawn out aspect ratio (AR) of 9.5 and wingspan of 1200mm, we think the HA1525 will set new flatwater pumping records limited only by your legs.&#160; Precision Fabrication Through meticulous attention to detail, we&#8217;ve given the HA range a truly premium layup. A high-density foam core is wrapped with intermediate and high modulus carbon fiber to keep things light and provide incredible flex response.&#160; Inspired Design To craft the best foil possible, we looked to those with unparalleled foiling knowledge. Sailing gurus and America&#8217;s Cup legends Pete Burling and Jimmy Spithill were integral in helping to develop the HA range, transmitting a piece of their history into your session. Features and Recommendations Ideal for lightwind winging, advanced riders 86kg (190lbs) and up. Excellent for downwinding in light to moderate conditions, advanced riders. Pair with HA195 stabilizer to unlock greater glide and looseness. Pair with 70cm fuselage to increase stability and pumping. Dimensions: Area: 1525 cm2 Wingspan: 1200 mm Foil weight: 1275 grams Aspect Ratio: 19.5 *Kit comes complete with - Carry case, Polycarbonate Pro Shims, Bi Directional Titanium Washers, Titanium T-nuts, Screws, Torx tool, Protective mast and Foil covers.</description>

<description>
THE HA1525 BRINGS THE RENOWNED GLIDE AND SPEED OF THE HIGH ASPECT RANGE TO RIDERS OVER 86KG (190LBS). We&#8217;ve found that this foil&#8217;s excellent low end ability makes lightwind cruising and tacking a breeze. Looking to link up endless bumps down the coast? The HA1525&#8217;s impressive speed and glide performance caters perfectly to advanced riders of all weights looking to maximise downwinders and flatwater pumping.&#160; Effortless Glide In our quest to create an inspiring range of High Aspect foils, we honed a design that emphasizes glide and speed. With this DNA, the HA1525 offers amazing top speed for its size and exciting performance for everything from the afternoon soul session to dialing in those tacks.&#160; Elegant and Smooth Breathtaking curves and flowing lines are the HA signature. With a drawn out aspect ratio (AR) of 9.5 and wingspan of 1200mm, we think the HA1525 will set new flatwater pumping records limited only by your legs.&#160; Precision Fabrication Through meticulous attention to detail, we&#8217;ve given the HA range a truly premium layup. A high-density foam core is wrapped with intermediate and high modulus carbon fiber to keep things light and provide incredible flex response.&#160; Inspired Design To craft the best foil possible, we looked to those with unparalleled foiling knowledge.

<title>Slingshot SupWinder</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=8282</link>
<description>
The sUP WINDer from Slingshot is the first of its kind stick on keel. It installs in minutes transforming your standard SUP board into an efficient wingsurfing board. With the sUP WINDer installed, a wing in your hands, and a little technique, you can stay upwind and return home to the same place you launched from. Great for teaching first time wingsurfers and exploring your local waterways. Using wind power you will propel yourself across the water at far higher speeds, while expending less energy than traditional paddling. If you do decide to use your board for standard paddling the keel is easily removable, while the streamlines stick-on fin-box remains attached the bottom of your board. Jump into the sport of wingsurfing now, using the SUP board you already own! &#160;</description>

<description>
The sUP WINDer from Slingshot is the first of its kind stick on keel. It installs in minutes transforming your standard SUP board into an efficient wingsurfing board. With the sUP WINDer installed, a wing in your hands, and a little technique, you can stay upwind and return home to the same place you launched from. Great for teaching first time wingsurfers and exploring your local waterways. Using wind power you will propel yourself across the water at far higher speeds, while expending less energy than traditional paddling. If you do decide to use your board for standard paddling the keel is easily removable, while the streamlines stick-on fin-box remains attached the bottom of your board. Jump into the sport of wingsurfing now, using the SUP board you already own! &#160;</description>

<title>RE Quick Release Recoil Wrist Leash 7'</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=10178</link>
<description>
The Quick Release Recoil Wrist leash is for riders that want to keep everything up high. The one-handed, comfortable, durable wrist closure is also equipped with a quick release for emergency situations. Staying connected to your wing is important&#8212;no one is going to argue that! But how and where you connect your wing leash to your body is always a debate. The coiled urethane cord keeps everything tidy and high when riding, as well as more manageable when getting on the board. In addition, if you use a harness while winging, the on-wrist connection will limit accidental hooking in of your leash. Features 7mm polyurethane cord Coiled quick-release cord construction Easy one-handed wrist cuff operation Neoprene-covered stainless-steel swivels Suggested use: Winging wing leash</description>

<description>
The Quick Release Recoil Wrist leash is for riders that want to keep everything up high. The one-handed, comfortable, durable wrist closure is also equipped with a quick release for emergency situations. Staying connected to your wing is important&#8212;no one is going to argue that! But how and where you connect your wing leash to your body is always a debate. The coiled urethane cord keeps everything tidy and high when riding, as well as more manageable when getting on the board. In addition, if you use a harness while winging, the on-wrist connection will limit accidental hooking in of your leash. Features 7mm polyurethane cord Coiled quick-release cord construction Easy one-handed wrist cuff operation Neoprene-covered stainless-steel swivels Suggested use: Winging wing leash</description>

<title>RE Quick Release Recoil Waist Leash</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=10180</link>
<description>
An ideal, safe solution with minimal drag and obstruction, the Ride Engine Recoil Waist Leash stays out of the way and is drag-free for SUP downwind runs or distance paddling. With multiple combinations of positions on the body and coiled construction, the RE-Recoil Waist Leash is the go-to leash set-up for wing foiling, allowing the hands to be free to focus on grip rather than moving the leash away. An easy-access release separates the belt from the cord if the need should arise. FEATURES 7mm polyurethane cord Coiled quick-release cord construction Rotating connection to waist belt and rail saver Stainless steel swivels Easy-adjust padded waist belt with quick clip 7&#39; extended length Suggested use: downwind and hydrofoil SUP, small-wave SUP surfing</description>

<description>
PERFORMANCE, SPEED AND GLIDE HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO THE NEXT LEVEL WITH OUR HIGH ASPECT RANGE. At 10.0 it&#8217;s a true Hight Aspect ratio foil that sets the standard for glide performance, while retaining enough handling that it can be turned easily, taking your ride to the next level. The HA725 is truly amazing, the turn radius and pitch stability are sublime! Sleek inflected tips help prevent ventilation even if the tip breaches. Scorching top end and effortless rail to rail, the HA725 pushes Your progression to the limit! For experienced wingers and kiters there is no comparison, it makes tacking so&#160;fun as the speed and glide drives you through manoeuvres. Combine this with amazing upwind angles and the riding never stops! The HA725 is also a solid wave slasher for surf and tow in. It&#8217;s fast, stable and allows you to draw the lines you want with speed and confidence! Developed with key design input from Pete Burling, Helmsman of Team New Zealand&#8217;s Americas Cup yacht (Current AC holders) and tested by legendary Sailor Jimmy Spithill. Pete, Armie and Jimmy became friends as foiling united their search and passion for ultimate performance and glide on downwind runs. The mad scientist and these high-performance sailing gurus have collaborated to create something the likes of which has not seen before outside the Americas Cup! Construction Construction is based around a high-density foam core, which is wrapped with 100% IM and High Modulus Carbon.&#160; The main Foils are shaped and refined for maximum stability and predictability at all speeds The foil sections have been carefully designed by one of the world&#8217;s foremost sport Foil designers.

Cutting edge pumping performance to complement the APF front foil range. &#160; The Pump 202 is designed specifically to complement the Armstrong Pump Foil (APF) front foil range. This stabiliser redefines pump foiling potential with its ultra-low stall speeds, incredible stability and high efficiency to take you further with less effort than ever. &#160; Easy to fly with ultra-low stall speeds Pitch stable to help build a natural pumping cadence Co-designed with aerospace engineer Chris Porter &#160; Achieve maximum time on foil If you&#8217;re just learning or already seasoned, a forgiving foil that helps keep you flying makes all the difference when building your pumping skills. The APF&#8217;s outline shape, straight leading edge and high camber foil section offer ultra low stall speeds, quick acceleration and a relaxed, efficient pumping cadence optimised for exploring flat water or cruising effortlessly on micro bumps. Set up for rock solid stability The APF delivers pitch stability in key phases of flight without completely sacrificing sensitivity and manoeuvrability for expert riders. The specially designed high camber Pump 202 stabiliser works in harmony with the APF to provide excellent pitch stability throughout the entire pump cycle. This solid feeling underfoot lets you focus on building your technique and developing efficiency to go further than ever before. Designed with Chris Porter Designed in collaboration with career aerospace engineer Chris Porter, the APF foil shares its DNA with his reputed Crisp 333 and 381 stabilisers. Our approach to finding gains across all areas of the foil design have led to a pump foil that&#8217;s truly designed from tip to tip for the discipline. &#160; Recommendations: PUMP FOIL:&#160;All weights Specifications: Span:&#160;397mm Area:&#160;202cm2 Aspect Ratio:&#160;7.8</description>

<title>2022 Armstrong CF950 V2 Front Wing</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=9648</link>
<description>
Maximum Carving Fun The CF950 delivers stellar manoeuvrability, making it ideal for carving turns, surfing waves or pushing the boundaries of wake and kite foiling. Designed for quick rail to rail response, with impressive grip and flow through the hardest foil surfing turns. Ultra-compact outline lends to progressive pop and soft landings for aerial wake foiling. Higher speed range and manoeuvrability make it ideal for kite foiling. Recommendations: * WING:&#160; Advanced riders of all weights in pumping to pumping+ conditions. SURF: &#160;Advanced riders of all weights in medium to pumping conditions. WAKE:&#160; Beginner riders up to 64kg (141lb), advanced riders of all weights. KITE:&#160; Riders 65-89kg (141-196lb). SUP:&#160; Riders of all weights in pumping conditions. BEGINNERS:&#160; Pair with TC70 fuselage and CF300 stabiliser INTERMEDIATE AND ADVANCED: &#160;Pair with TC60 fuselage and HS232 or HA195 stabilisers. &#160; Specifications: AREA: &#160;950sq/cm WINGSPAN: &#160;670mm WEIGHT: &#160;950gr AR: &#160;5 Stability Is Confidence A stable, predictable foil helps to make progression easier and safer. If you&#8217;re just beginning your foiling journey or are already an advanced rider, this range has a size tailored for you. More Flight Time Whether you&#39;re trying your first gybes or perfecting your backflips, the CF V2&#39;s exceptionally forgiving low speed handling keeps the foil flying easily while you focus on the manoeuvre. Inspiring You To Push It Designed to inspire confidence, this range of foils enables intermediate and advanced riders to explore new territory whether it&#8217;s under a wing, behind a boat, or on a wave face. A Future-Proofed System Sized from 950 to 2050sq/cm, the CFv2 range truly caters to the full spectrum of rider levels, weights and foiling sports. As your experience level and style evolve, the modular Armstrong A+ System offers component choices to match your progression. *Recommendations are meant only as a general guideline. Different components and conditions may influence rider experience.</description>

<title>Straight Line Hydra-Tak Wakeboard Handle W/ Team Rope Combo</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=3266</link>

This simplistic, functional handle is great for wakeskating behind a boat, pwc, or winch. (50&#39;+10&#39;+5&#39;+5&#39;+5&#39;+5&#39;, HANDLE) Combine the grippy and sticky HydraTak handle with a coated rope that resists twists and knots, and you get the best value in a pro level package, all at a recreational price. &#160;</description>

<title>Armstrong Power Link Control Bar</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=9257</link>
<description>
INNOVATION AND THOUGHTFUL DESIGN ARE AT OUR HEART, THE NEW POWERLINK CONTROL BAR IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF OUR DEDICATION TO THE DESIGN ETHOS. During the testing of the A-Wing, Armie developed the Powerlink Control Bar with the goal of increasing the handling and range of the A-Wing. Linking the middle handles allows for easy hand transfers, enhanced wing control during transitions and for wave riding. It improves light wind power, with both hands on the bar it sets the wing higher and further from body turbulence, which improves low-end grunt. It also adds to upper-end wind range by allowing your rear hand to move forward for the optimal control position in powered conditions. Although the Power Control Bar has been developed primarily for the A-Wing, as an added bonus it can also easily be fitted to many other brands wings. Power link control Bar length is 520mm (Please check the length of other brand fitting points)</description>

<title>Armstrong MA800 Foil Kit</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=9978</link>
<description>
Armstrong&#39;s next generation foils. MA (Mid Aspect) takes everything they&#39;ve learned from the HS, HA and CF V2 ranges and delivers a truly next-gen combination of glide, low stall speed, intuitive carving and instantaneous breach recovery. These foils offer the best of all worlds to experienced riders in every foil sport. STELLAR GLIDE AND ACCELERATION A specially tuned leading edge shape gives MA foils stellar glide and highly responsive acceleration. They&#8217;re a dream to pump when connecting wave sets, downwinding in open ocean swell, or riding way back on a boat wake. LOW END LIFT AND BROAD SPEED RANGE Thanks to its high camber foil section, the MA range delivers a unique blend of lift at low speeds yet retains excellent controllability at the top end. This makes getting onto foil and pumping easier while reducing your chances of being &#8220;over foiled&#8221; in big conditions. FLUID CARVING There&#8217;s nothing better than feeling connected to the foil through a turn, which is why we&#8217;ve designed the MA foils to deliver seamless and intuitive control through the full range of bank angles. LIGHTNING FAST VENTILATION RECOVERY From breaching a wingtip in the surf to landing an air, the MA range handles ventilation with ease. A fine leading edge section and tuned wingtip inflection allow for quick flow reattachment after a breach, making these foils the perfect platform for practicing aerials or ripping the hardest turns of your foiling journey. MA800 The highly rippable performance machine. Specifications Projected Area: 800cm2 Span: 765mm AR: 7.32 Angle relative to fuselage: 1.5 deg. Rider Recommendations Wing: Intermediate-Advanced Prone Surf: Advanced SUP Surf: Advanced Kite: Intermediate-Advanced &#160; What&#8217;s included? MA800 Front Wing, Flow 235 Stabilizer, 85cm v2 Plate mast, TC60cm V2 Fuselage, Shims, Carry Bag, and all necessary hardware + Torx tool.&#160; This kit is the highly rippable performance foil. Perfect for accomplished riders: Kiting, tow, Surf, and wing foiling! Options to swap the fuselage and mast. &#160; &#160; &#160;</description>

<title>Armstrong Carbon Tail Kick Pad</title>
<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=9805</link>
<description>
OUR ADJUSTABLE CARBON TRACK TAIL KICK PAD TAKES THE DESIGN INTO THE NEXT LEVEL. We understand that foot position is crucial to maintain maximum control at all times, it is also unique to every rider due to weight and height. We designed our tail pad to run on a carbon plate that has adjustable positions, which means you can set the tail kick in just the right place so your rear foot is located in the perfect position every time. &#160; We&#8217;ve found that it is good to start foiling with your back foot placed directly above the mast, this is the natural position. Once up and riding you can experiment putting your back foot just in front or just behind the mast to find what is your ideal positioning for your weight size and style. &#160;</description>

<link>https://www.jupiterkiteboarding.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=4130</link>
<description>
This paddle concept was created and shaped by legendary Waterman Dave Kalama. Its design features a unique scooped V section that&#8217;s edges create a double dihedral for enhanced stability during the power application. The results offer a very stable yet effective power phase with an effortless exit. Great for catching waves, racing and touring.&#160; Specifications &#160; SIZE SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Blade Area 81 sq. in 91 sq. in 101 sq. in Blade Length 16.5&quot; 17&quot; 17.5&quot; Blade Width &#160; 7.5&quot; 8.3&quot; Weight &#160; From 14 oz.
